<p>2) when the ""iter=10"", the 'simple_preprocess' is executed 11 times. If my own customized 'preprocess' is very heavy, is this going to be very slow? How to avoid this preprocessing repetitions in using genism word2vec?</p>

<p><code>AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'EpochProgress' on &lt;module '__main__'&gt;</code></p>

<p>I've successfully trained numerous models with Gensim in the past on this system.

<p>Here is how I did the epoch progress tracking/saving:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>class EpochProgress(CallbackAny2Vec):

</code></pre>

<p><code>epoch_progress = EpochProgress('E:/jade_prism/embeddings/phrase-embed-over- time/mega_WOS_word2vec/w2v_models/in_progress/')</code></p>

<p>I then load the baseline model with the vocab build and set a few parameters:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>model = gensim.models.Word2Vec.load(baseline_models_directory+chosen_name)
model.window = window
model.size = size
model.workers = workers 
model.callbacks = [epoch_progress]
</code></pre>

<p>Then I do the training like this:</p>

<p><code>model.train(corpus, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=epochs)</code></p>

<p>And finally, save the end product like this: </p>

<p><code>model.save('E:/w2v_models/trained/{}'.format(new_model_filename))</code></p>

<p>Training appeared to work properly, and model saved as expected- unfortunately now I can't load it.</p>

the data size is about 989.6 MB.

Loss after epoch 7: 0.0
Loss after epoch 8: 0.0
Loss after epoch 9: 0.0

<p>All losses of 0!!!
I start to get very suspicious at this point.</p>
<p>Note: Each element of <code>sentences</code> are independent, I hop the library don't try to mix different terms in different arrays.</p>
<p>For trying to test the model, I tried a very frequent query like <code>model.wv.most_similar('query_t-shirt', topn=100)</code> and the results are completely absurd.</p>

I'm wondering if it is possible to use the method print_topics (I forgot to say that loading the model is working and I can get all the topics and their words) and for each topics , retrieve the weight of the words related to the topics and compute the probability but I don't know how the lda model predict the topic for each document, so I'm not sure if my idea can work.</p>

<p>I posted in the gensim...forum? I dunno if that's what it's called. The guy that wrote the package responded and had this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how big is your term-document CSV matrix?</p>
  
  <p>If it's small enough = fits in RAM, you could: </p>
  
  <p>1) use numpy.loadtxt()
  to load your CSV into an in-memory matrix </p>
  
  <p>2) convert the matrix to a corpus with gensim.matutils.Dense2Corpus() . Check out its documents_columns flag, it lets you switch between document-term and term-document transposition easily. </p>
  
  <p>3) use that corpus to train your LDA model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that leads me to believe that the answer to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27220927/passing-term-document-matrix-to-gensim-lda-model"">this question</a> isn't correct. </p>

<p>It seems like a dictionary is a necessary input to a LDA model; is this not correct? Here's what I have that I think successfully sticks the .csv into a corpus. </p>

<pre><code>file = np.genfromtxt(fname=fPathName, dtype=""int"", delimiter="","", skip_header=True, missing_values="""", filling_values=0)


corpus = gensim.matutils.Dense2Corpus(file, documents_columns=False)

<pre><code>sent1 = 'aston martin is a car brand'
sent2 = 'audi is a car brand'
sent3 = 'bmw is a car brand'

<p>In this way, I would like to use <code>gensim Phrases</code> to learn so that output looks like:</p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models import Phrases
sents = [sent1, sent2, sent3, ...]
sents_stream = [sent.split() for sent in sents]
bigram = Phrases(sents_stream)

for sent in sents:

# Ouput should be like:
['aston_martin', 'car', 'brand']
['audi', 'car', 'brand']
['bmw', 'car', 'brand']
...

<p>However, if a lot of sentences that have a lot of punctuation:</p>

<pre><code>sent1 = 'aston martin is a car brand'
sent2 = 'audi is a car brand'
sent3 = 'bmw is a car brand'
sent4 = 'jaguar, aston martin, mini cooper are british car brand'
sent5 = 'In all brand, I love jaguar, aston martin and mini cooper'

<p>Then the output looks like:</p>

sents_stream = [sent.split() for sent in sents]
bigram = Phrases(sents_stream)

['jaguar', 'aston', 'martin_mini', 'cooper', 'british', 'car', 'brand']
['all', 'brand', 'love', 'jaguar', 'aston', 'martin_mini', 'cooper']
...
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, how should I handle the sentence with lot of punctuation to prevent <code>martin_mini</code> case and make the output looks like:</p>

<pre><code>['aston', 'martin', 'car', 'brand']
['audi', 'car', 'brand']
['bmw', 'car', 'brand']

The parameters I passed, based on the documentation, seem that they shouldn't be causing so many entries to be 0.

<p><strong>Is it true then that the default random seed is fixed?</strong> If so, what is the default random seed number? Or is it because I'm testing on a small dataset? </p>

<p>If it's true that the the random seed is fixed and different runs on the same data returns the same vectors, a link to a canonical code or documentation would be much appreciated.  </p>

Consider the following informal example. I have the two corpora each consisting of a set of documents:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>[['i', 'live', 'in', 'new', 'york'], ['new', 'york', 'is', 'busy'], ...]</code></li>
<li><code>[['los', 'angeles', 'is', 'sunny'], ['los', 'angeles', 'has', 'bad', 'traffic'], ...]</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, I would like <code>new_york</code> to be detected as a compound phrase. However, when corpus 2 is replaced by</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><code>[['i', 'go', 'to', 'new', york'], ['i', 'like', 'new', 'york'], ...]</code>,</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like <code>new_york</code> to be relatively disregarded.</p>
<p>I could just use a ratio between n-gram scores between corresponding phrases in corpora, but I don't see how to scale to general n. Normally, phrase detection for n-grams with <code>n&gt;2</code> is done by recursing on <code>n</code> and gradually inserting compound phrases into the documents by thresholding a score function. This insures that at step <code>n</code>, if you want to score the <code>n</code>-gram <code>(w_1, ..., w_n)</code>, then you can always normalize by the constituent <code>m</code>-grams for <code>m&lt;n</code>. But with a different corpus, these are not guaranteed to appear.</p>

I would like to check if this clustering is equal to those labels. I mean, I want to check if a document labeled as class 1 is grouped by k-means with others from the same class, for example.
So I was thinking of using a different symbol for each class, like, in this plot all documents are represented as dots, can I do the plot with a different symbol for each class? Is that a good way to check this? (visually)</p>
<p>Also, how could I check the accuracy of this? To see how much of those 1000 documents were clustered with the others that have the same value in my dataset (column: df['Classes'])</p>

<p>Clinical Guidelines for the Management of IBD.</p>
<p>Polygenetic risk scores do not add predictive power to clinical models for response to anti-TNFα therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.
Anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapy is widely used in the management of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, up to a third of patients do not respond to induction therapy and another third of patients lose response over time. To aid patient stratification, polygenetic risk scores have been identified as predictors of response to anti-TNFα therapy. We aimed to replicate the association between polygenetic risk scores and response to anti-TNFα therapy in an independent cohort of patients, to establish its clinical validity.</p>

Since my aim is also to analyze the prevalence of certain topics over time, I was thinking of using doc2vec instead so as to simultaneously learn word and document embeddings. The 'prevalence' of topics in a document could then be calculated as the cosine similarities between doc vectors and word embeddings (or combinations of word vectors). In this way, I can calculate the annual topical prevalence in the corpus and see whether there's any changes over time. An example of such an approach can be found <a href=""https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03490"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>My issue is that the avg. yearly cosine similarities yield really strange results. As an example, the cosine similarities between document vectors and a mixture of keywords related to covid-19/coronavirus show a decrease in topical prevalence since 2016 (which obviously cannot be the case).</p>
<p>My question is whether the approach that I'm following is actually valid. Or that maybe there's something that I'm missing. A 250k documents and 100k + vocabulary should be sufficient enough?</p>

<p>The authors just used gensim's word2vec as a default status without including any options, so my question is what is the default estimation method for gensim's word2vec under Skip-gram embeddings. NCE? According to your manual,  it just says there is an option for negative sampling, and if set to 0, then no negative sampling is used. But then what estimation method is used?
negative (int, optional) – If &gt; 0, negative sampling will be used, the int for negative specifies how many “noise words” should be drawn (usually between 5-20). If set to 0, no negative sampling is used.</p>

<p>I'm using the function <code>Word2Vec</code> from the python library <code>gensim</code>.</p>

<p>My problem is that I <strong>can't run my model on every word of my corpus as long as I set the parameter <code>min_count</code> greater than one</strong>. Some would say it's logic cause I choose to ignore the words appearing only once. But the function is behaving weird cause it gives an <strong>error saying <em>word 'blabla' is not in the vocabulary</em></strong>, whereas this is exactly what I want ( I want this word to be out of the vocabulary).</p>

<p>I can imagine this is not very clear, then find below a reproducible example:</p>

<pre><code>import gensim
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

# My corpus

       [""praha"",""better"",""great"",""than"",""paris""],

# Load a pre-trained model - The orignal one based on google news

<p>As notified in the commentaries of the code: running the model on 'paris' works but not on 'country'. And of course, if I set the parameter <code>min_count</code> to 1, everything works fine.</p>

<p>I hope it is clear enough.</p>

<p>The pipeline is as follows: <code>text</code> -&gt; <code>d2v</code> -&gt; <code>clf</code></p>
<p>EDIT: based on comments.
I am not looking to augment prior to d2v training. I am using my trained model for a downstream task which looks like this:</p>
<p>text -&gt; d2v -&gt; binary classifier</p>
<p>Lets say I am predicting sentiment, but I have only a few positive samples:</p>

<p>So I am making more samples by augmenting the positive:</p>
<p>&quot;the dog is ecstatic&quot;</p>
<p>Now I have two samples which I pass to d2v to vectorize and use downstream rather than one.</p>
<p>My question is therefore what sort of augmentation works, because for example since d2v in some modes does not care much about word order, doing things like &quot;sentence swap&quot; could be useless.</p>

<p>My model is running now for about more than 30 hours now. This is doubtful since on my i5 laptop with 8 cores, I'm using all the 8 cores at 100% for every moment of time. Plus, my program seems to have read more than 100 GB of data from the disk now. I don't know if there is anything wrong here, but the main reason after my doubt on the training is because of this 100 GB of read from the disk. The whole corpus is of 34 GB, then why my code has read 100 GB of data from the disk? Does anyone know how much time should it take to train word2vec on 34 GB of text, with 8 cores of i5 CPU running all in parallel? Thank you. For more information, I'm also attaching the photo of my process from system monitor. </p>

<p>I want to know why my model has read 112 GB from memory, even when my corpus is of 34 GB in total? Will my training ever get finished? Also I'm bit worried about health of my laptop, since it is running constantly at its peak capacity since last 30 hours. It is really hot now. 
Should I add any additional parameter in <code>Word2Vec</code> for quicker training without much performance loss?</p>

<p>When that didn't work, I attempted to bring in the raw text but got lots of UTF-8 encoding errors with unrecognizable characters.  I attempted to work around this issue, finally getting to a point where it tried to read in the raw text file - only for the single character returns to come back.</p>
<p>So it seems the issue persists regardless of if I use my csv file or if I use the txt file.  So I'd prefer to stick with the csv as I've already processed the information; how can I bring that data in without Python (or gensim) seeing the individual characters as the unit of analysis?</p>

So I've planned to use a wikipedia dump and process it the following way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extract each article from frwiki-YYYYMMDD-pages-articles.xml.bz2 (Done)</li>
<li>Tokenize each article (basically converting the text to lowercases, removing stop words and non-word characters) (Done)</li>
<li>Train a Phrases model on the articles to detect collocation.</li>
<li>Stem the resulting tokens in each article.</li>
<li>Feed the dictionary with the new corpus (one stemmed-collocated-tokenized article per line)</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of the very large size of the corpus, I don't store anything in memory and access the corpus via smart_open but it appears gensim Phrases model is consuming too much RAM to complete the third step.</p>

<p>Here is my sample code:</p>

<pre><code>corpus = smart_open(corpusFile, ""r"")
phrases = gensim.models.Phrases()
with smart_open(phrasesFile, ""wb"") as phrases_file:
    chunks_size = 10000
    texts, i = [], 0
    for text in corpus:
        texts.append(text.split())
        i += 1
        if i % chunks_size == 0:
            phrases.add_vocab(texts)
            texts = []
    phrases.save(phrases_file)
corpus.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to complete the operation without freezing my computer or will I have to train the Phrases model only on a subset of my corpus?</p>

<li>Treat each university dictionary as a document in a new corpus. Turn it into a BoW representation, and build a model from that.  TfIdf/LSI/LDA.</li>

<p>Since, the Perplexity and Coherence Scores shows that LDA model would work better with 250 number of  topics.</p>

Currently, I'm trying to load a model once (due to size and loading time), so it stays in memory and access its similarity functions multiple thousands times in a row.

<p>The wrapper class. Initiated once.</p>

<p>So for each corpus of articles I've tokenized, detected collocations, stemmed and then fed a little dictionary (around 20k tokens) I've passed though a TFIDF model.</p>

<p>Finally I've used the TFIDF corpus to build a LSI model of the corpus and with the help of the document similarity functions of gensim I was able to get very good results.</p>

<p>But I was curious and made some coherence checking of the LSI with:</p>

<pre><code>lsi_topics = [[word for word, prob in topic] for topicid, topic in 
lsi.show_topics(formatted=False)]
lsi_coherence = CoherenceModel(topics=lsi_topics[:10], texts=corpus, dictionary=dictionary, window_size=10).get_coherence()
logger.info(""lsi coherence: %.3f"" % lsi_coherence)

<p>And I always get values around 0.45 which could seem pretty weak.</p>

<p>So I was wondering how to interpret this coherence value? And does this value make sense when you only need similarity of documents in the index to the index itself (so the queries are a full document from the corpus)?</p>

<p>Edit: I tried different things for text preprocessing such as splitting each document in real sentences before feeding the Phrases class, generating bigrams, trigrams or removing accents or not and in some cases I was able to get a coherence value around 0.55 so at least I guess it can help finding the most efficient way to process raw datas...</p>

The underlying problem I am trying to solve is binary classification of a series of tweets. To do so I am modifying the code in <a href=""https://github.com/halidebey/PyCon2018/blob/master/analysis.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> git repo.</p>

<p>Here is part of the code relating to tokenization:</p>

<pre><code>from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer
tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+')
input_file[""tokens""] = input_file[""text""].apply(tokenizer.tokenize)
all_words = [word for tokens in input_file[""tokens""] for word in tokens]
sentence_lengths = [len(tokens) for tokens in input_file[""tokens""]]
vocabulary = sorted(set(all_words))
</code></pre>

<p>Now here is the part where I use Gensim's sklearn-api to try to vectorize my tweets:</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from gensim.test.utils import common_texts
from gensim.sklearn_api import W2VTransformer
text = input_file[""text""].tolist()
labels = input_file[""label""].tolist()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(text, labels, test_size=0.2,random_state=40)
model = W2VTransformer(size=10, min_count=1, seed=1)
X_train_w2v = model.fit(common_texts).transform(X_train)
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the following error:</p>

<pre><code>KeyError: ""word 'Great seeing you again, don't be a stranger!' not in vocabulary""
</code></pre>

<p>It seems that part of the issue is that Gensim is expecting to be fed one word at a time and instead it is getting entire tweets.</p>

<p>X_train is of type list, here are the first three elements of the list:</p>

<pre><code>[""Great seeing you again, don't be a stranger!"",
 ""Beautiful day here in sunny Prague. Not a cloud in the sky"",
 "" pfft! i wish I had a laptop like that""]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>In order to remedy this, I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>X_train_list = []
for sentence in X_train:
word_list = sentence.split(' ')
while("""" in word_list): 
    word_list.remove("""") 
X_train_list.append(word_list)
model = W2VTransformer(size=10, min_count=1, seed=1)
X_train_tfidf = model.fit(common_texts).transform(X_train_list)
</code></pre>

<p>This produces the following error:</p>

<pre><code>KeyError: ""word 'here' not in vocabulary""
</code></pre>

<p>To be honest, this one blows my mind! How a common word like 'here' is not in the vocabulary is beyond me. Also wondering if tweets with stray letters will throwing errors, I imagine the weird jumbles of letters that often pass for words will cause similar issues.</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken, this is having to measure each document to every other document. I think computation time might be massively reduced if I change this to <code>topn=1</code> instead since the only thing I want to know is if the most similar document is itself or not. Doing this will basically take each doc (i.e., <code>inferred_vector</code>), measure its most similar document (i.e., <code>topn=1</code>), and then I just see if it is itself or not. How could I implement this? Any help or idea is welcome.</p>

My goal is to match people by interest, so the dataset consists of names and short sentences describing their hobbies. The batches are fairly small, few hundreds of people, so i wanted to give it a try before digging into doc2vec.</p>

<p>I prepare the data by cleaning it completely, removing stop words, tokenizing and lemmatizing. I use pre-trained model for word vectors which returns adequate results when finding similarities for some test words. Also tried summing up the sentence words to find similarities in the original model - the matches do make sense. The similarities would be around general sense of the phrase.</p>

<p>For sentence matching I'm trying the following: create an empty model</p>

<pre><code>b = gs.models.Word2Vec(min_count=1, size=300, sample=0, hs=0)
</code></pre>

<p>Build vocab out of names (or person id's), no training</p>

<pre><code>#first create vocab with an empty vector
test = [['test']]
b.build_vocab(test)
b.wv.syn0[b.wv.vocab['test'].index] = b.wv.syn0[b.wv.vocab['test'].index]*0

#populate vocab from an array
b.build_vocab([personIds], update=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Summ each sentence's word vectors and store the results into the model for a corresponding id</p>

<pre><code>#sentences are pulled from pandas dataset df. 'a' is a pre-trained model i use to get vectors for each word

def summ(phrase, start_model):
    '''
    vector addition function
    '''
    #starting with a vector of 0's
    sum_vec = start_model.word_vec(""cat_NOUN"")*0
    for word in phrase:
        sum_vec += start_model.word_vec(word)
    return sum_vec

for i, row in df.iterrows():
    try:
        personId = row[""ID""]
        summVec = summ(df.iloc[i,1],a)
        #updating syn0 for each name/id in vocabulary
        b.wv.syn0[b.wv.vocab[personId].index] = summVec
    except:
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>I understand that i shouldn't be expecting much accuracy here, but the t-SNE print doesn't show any clustering whatsoever. Finding similarities method also fails to find matches (&lt;0.2 similarity coefficient basically for everything). [<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/w81nX.png"" alt=""]plot of the entire model[1]""></p>

<p>Wondering if anyone has an idea of where did i go wrong? Is my approach valid at all?</p>

My problem is that tensorboard seems to freeze while computing PCA. At first, I left the page open for 16 hours, imagining that it was just too much to be calculated, but nothing happened. At this point, I started to try and test different scenarios just in case all I needed was more time and I was trying to rush things. The following is a list of my testing so far, all of which failed at the same spot, computing PCA:</p>

<ul>
<li>I plotted only 10 points of 200 dimensions;</li>
<li>I retrained my gensim model so that I could reduce its dimensionality to 100;</li>
<li>Then I reduced it to 10;</li>
<li>Then to 2;</li>
<li>Then I tried plotting only 2 points, i.e. 2 two dimensional points;</li>

<p>Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Updates:</p>

<p>A) I've found someone else <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44054907/tensorfboard-embeddings-hangs-with-computing-pca"">dealing with the same problem</a>; I tried the solution provided, but it didn't change anything. </p>

<p>B) I thought it could have something to do with my installation, therefore I tried uninstalling tensorflow and installing it back; no luck. I then proceeded to create a new environment dedicated to tensorflow and that also didn't work. </p>

<p>C) Assuming there was something wrong with my code, I ran <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tensorflow's basic embedding tutorial</a> to check if I could open its projector's results. And guess what?! I still can't go past ""Calculating PCA""</p>

<p>Now, I did visit <a href=""https://projector.tensorflow.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the online projector example</a> and that loads perfectly. </p>

<p>Let's say the GloVe vectors have dimensions <code>[NUM_VOCAB, EMBEDDING_SIZE]</code>. The zero index is masked (ignored) so to get the proper indexing of words, do we add an extra column to the GloVe matrix so the dimensions are: <code>[NUM_VOCAB+1, EMBEDDING_SIZE]</code>?</p>

<p>I am training Doc2Vec with 150000 documents. Since these documents are from legal domain they are really hard to clean and get it ready for further training. Hence I decided to remove all the periods from a document. Having said that, I am confused on how the parameter of <code>Window_size</code> in doc2vec recognize the sentences now. There are two views presented in the question :<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42242521/doc2vec-differentiate-sentence-and-document"">Doc2Vec: Differentiate Sentence and Document</a> </p>

<ol>
<li>The algorithm just works on chunks of text, without any idea of what a sentence/paragraph/document etc might be.</li>
<li>It's even common for the tokenization to retain punctuation, such as the periods between sentences, as standalone tokens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore I am in confusion if my adopted approach of eliminating the punctuation (periods) is right. Kindly provide me with some supportive answers.</p>

<p>Doubt-2</p>

<p>The documents that I scrapped range from 500 - 5500 tokens hence my approach to have a pretty even sized documents for training doc2vec and even to reduce the vocabulary is :
Consider a document of size greater than 1500 tokens in this case I make use of First 50 to 400 tokens + 600 to 1000 tokens + last 250 tokens. The motivation for this kind of approach is from a paper related to Classification of documents using BERT where the sequence of 512 tokens were generated like this.</p>

<p>So I want to know if this idea is somewhat good to proceed or it's not recommended to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> - I just saw the common_text corpus used by gensim in the tutorial link <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html</a> and found that the documents in that corpus are simply tokens of words and do not contain any punctuation.
 eg: </p>

<p><code>from gensim.test.utils import common_texts, common_dictionary, common_corpus</code></p>

<p><code>print(common_texts[0:10])</code></p>

<p>Output:</p>

<p><code>[['human', 'interface', 'computer'], ['survey', 'user', 'computer', 'system', 'response', 'time'], ['eps', 'user', 'interface', 'system'], ['system', 'human', 'system', 'eps'], ['user', 'response', 'time'], ['trees'], ['graph', 'trees'], ['graph', 'minors', 'trees'], ['graph', 'minors', 'survey']]</code></p>

<p>Same has been followed in the tutorial <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_doc2vec_lee.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/auto_examples/tutorials/run_doc2vec_lee.html</a>.
So is my approach of removing periods in the document valid, if so then how will the window parameter work because in the documentation it is defined as follows:
window (int, optional) – The maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence.</p>

<p>I'm pretty new to Python. I've done a RandomForestClassifier model successfully at my organization and the model is in production, but neural nets are beyond my current comprehension.</p>

<p>I'm working on a text classification problem in Python. I had 243 samples (rows) that are taken from 25 job postings. I have one column that is the string sentence, and one column that is the job posting that it came from. </p>

<p>I'm gunning for a promotion at work, and thought this would be a neat opportunity to learn about neural networks. (I'm not going for a data scientist-type role, this just fascinates me.) Each sample is one ""job duty"" from a job posting, and each ""document"" is a job posting. One job posting could have multiple duties that are nearly identical, every job posting should have 2-3 identical (abstracted) duties, and ultimately, I assume there will be 15-20 clusters of ""duties"" from my 25 job postings. </p>

<p>Essentially, my desired output is to classify each row (regardless of which job posting it came from; I don't think my document column is relevant) to n clusters. I don't expect labels for my clusters. </p>

<p>I've cleaned my 243 samples; removing punctuation and stopwords, and have it in a dataframe.</p>

<p>The packages I've experimented with so far are Keras, doc2vec, word2vec, nltk, and Soundex</p>

def train_model(fname):
    logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
    dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(line.lower().split() for line in open(fname))
    print ""DOC2BOW""
    corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(line.lower().split()) for line in open(fname)]

    print ""running LDA""
    lda = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=100, update_every=1, chunksize=10000, asses=1)
</code></pre>

<p>running this script on a small corpus (2M sentences) I realized that it needs about 7GB of RAM.
And when I try to run it on the larger corpora, it fails because of the memory issue.
The problem is obviously due to the fact that I am loading the corpus using this command:</p>

<pre><code>corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(line.lower().split()) for line in open(fname)]
</code></pre>

<p>But, I think there is no other way because I would need it for calling the LdaModel() method:</p>

<pre><code>lda = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=100, update_every=1, chunksize=10000, asses=1)
</code></pre>

<p>I searched for a solution to this problem but I could not find anything helpful.
I would imagine that it should be a common problem since we mostly train the models on very large corpora (usually wikipedia documents). So, it should be already a solution for it.</p>

<p>Any ideas about this issue and the solution for it?</p>

<pre><code>emd(d1, d2, distance_matrix)

<p>where </p>

<pre><code>d1 =  # Compute nBOW representation of reference_setence.

<p>This code is inefficient in two ways for my use case. </p>

<p>1) For the reference sentence, it is repeatedly calculating d1 (1000 times) for the distance function <code>emd(d1, d2, distance_matrix)</code>.</p>

<p>2) This distance function is called by multiple users from different points which repeat this whole process of <code>model.wmdistance(doc1, doc2)</code> for the same other_sentences and it is computationally expensive. For this 1000 comparisons, it takes around 7-8 seconds. </p>

<p>Therefore, I would like to isolate the two tasks. The final calculation of distance: <code>emd(d1, d2, distance_matrix)</code> and the preparation of these inputs: d1, d2, and distance matrix. As distance matrix depends on both so at least its input preparation should be isolated from the final matrix calculation. </p>

<p>My initial plan is to create three customized functions: </p>

<pre><code>d1 = prepared1(reference_sentence)
d2 = prepared2(other_sentence)
distance_matrix inputs = prepare inputs

<p>Is it possible to do this with this <code>gensim</code> function or should I just go my own customized version? Any ideas and solutions to deal with this problem in a better way?</p>

<p>It looks like the ap data needs to be downloaded separately (not mentioned in the book), so by doing this:</p>

<pre><code>sh download_ap.sh

<p>I experimented by replacing <code>X_train</code> in <code>cross_val_score</code> with <code>model.transform(X_train)</code> or <code>model.fit_transform(X_train)</code>. Also, I tried the same with raw input data (<code>data.text</code>), instead of pre-processed text. I suspect that something must be wrong with the format of <code>X_train</code> for the cross-validation, as compared to the <code>.score</code> function for Pipeline, which works just fine.

To start, here is my current understanding of the model motivated with an example.  I am using Python <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gensim</a> as I go.</p>

<p>Here I have a corpus with three sentences.</p>

<pre><code>sentences = [
    ['i', 'like', 'cats', 'and', 'dogs'],
    ['i', 'like', 'dogs'],
    ['dogs', 'like', 'dogs']
]
</code></pre>

<p>From this, I can determine my vocabulary, <code>V = ['and', 'cats', 'dogs', 'i', 'like']</code>.</p>

<p>Following <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4546.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a> by Tomas Mikolov (and others)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic Skip-gram formulation defines p(w_t+j |w_t) using the softmax
  function:</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hza7Q.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hza7Q.gif"" alt=""skipgram""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>where v_w and v′_w are the “input” and “output” vector representations
  of w, and W is the number of words in the vocabulary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my understanding, the skip-gram model involves two matrices (I'll call them <em>I</em> and <em>O</em>) which are the vector representations of ""input/center"" words and the vector representation of ""output/context"" words.  Assuming d = 2 (vector dimension or 'size' as its called in genism), <em>I</em> should be a 2x5 matrix and <em>O</em> should be a 5x2 matrix.  At the start of the training procedure, these matrices are filled with random values (yes?).  So we might have</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
np.random.seed(2017)

I = np.random.rand(5,2).round(2)  # 5 rows by 2 cols
[[ 0.02  0.77] # and
 [ 0.45  0.12] # cats
 [ 0.93  0.65] # dogs
 [ 0.14  0.23] # i
 [ 0.23  0.26]] # like

O = np.random.rand(2,5).round(2)  # 2 rows by 5 cols
  #and  #cats #dogs  #i   #like 
[[ 0.11  0.63  0.39  0.32  0.63]
 [ 0.29  0.94  0.15  0.08  0.7 ]]
</code></pre>

<p>Now if I want to calculate the probability that the word ""dogs"" appears in the context of ""cats"" I should do</p>

<p>exp([0.39, 0.15] * [0.45  0.12])/(...) = (0.1125)/(...)</p>

<p>A few questions on this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is my understanding of the algorithm correct thus far?</li>
<li>Using genism, I can train a model on this data using</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>import gensim
model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences, sg = 1, size=2, window=1, min_count=1)
model.wv['dogs']  # array([ 0.06249372,  0.22618999], dtype=float32)
</code></pre>

<p>For the array given, is that the vector for ""dogs"" in the Input matrix or the Output matrix?  Is there a way to view both matrices in the final model?</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Why does <code>model.wv.similarity('cats','cats')</code> = 1?  I thought this should be closer to 0, since the data would indicate that the word ""cats"" is unlikely to occur in the context of the word ""cats"".</li>

<p>I'm running gensim word2vec on every word, and then taking the simple average of each sentence. The problem is that I use min_count=1000, so a lot of words are not in the vocab. </p>

<p>To solve that, I intersect the vocab array (that contains about 10000 words) with every sentence, and if there's at least one element left in that intersection, it returns its the simple average, otherwise, it returns a vector of zeros.</p>

<p>The issue is that calculating every average takes a very long time when I run it on the whole dataset, even when splitting into multiple threads, and I would like to get a better solution that could run faster.</p>

<p>I'm running this on an EC2 r4.4xlarge instance.</p>

The closest word to the centroid of class 0 is rabbit, the distance is 1.578625818679259
The closest word to the centroid of class 1 is fruit, the distance is 1.8351978219013796
The closest word to the centroid of class 2 is car, the distance is 1.6586030662247868

<p>In the code I have 3 categories of words: vehicle, fruit and animal. From the output we can see that k-means correctly clustered the words for all 3 categories, but the representative words derived using the centroid method are not very good, as for class 0 I want to see ""animal"" but it gives ""rabbit"", and for class 2 I want to see ""vehicle"" but it returns ""car"".</p>

<p>Any help or suggestion in finding the good representative word for each cluster will be highly appreciated.</p>

<pre><code>def encode_sentences(self, w2v_params, sentences):
    model = Word2Vec(sentences, **w2v_params)
    
    idx_order = torch.tensor([int(i) for i in model.wv.index2entity], dtype=torch.long)
    X = torch.zeros((idx_order.max()+1, w2v_params['size']), dtype=torch.float)
    
    # Put embeddings back in order
    X[idx_order] = torch.tensor(model.wv.vectors)    
    return X, y
</code></pre>
<p>What I'm hoping for here, is each time w2v runs, it starts with a fresh model and trains from scratch. However, I'm testing 3 kinds of sentences, so my test code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def test(sentence):
    w2v = {'size': 128, 'sg': 1}
    X = encode_sentences(w2v, sentence)
    evaluate(X) # Basic cluster analysis stuff here

# s1, s2 and s3 are the 3 sets of sentences with the same vocabulary in different order/frequency
[print(test(s) for s in [s1, s2, s3]]
</code></pre>
<p>However, I noticed if I remove one of the test sets, and only test <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> (or any combination of 2 sets of the three), the overall quality of the clusterings decreases. If I go back into <code>encode_sentences</code> and add <code>del model</code> before the <code>return</code> call, the overall cluster quality also goes down but remains consistent no matter how many datasets are tested.</p>
<p>What gives? Is the constructor not actually building a fresh model each time with new weights? The docs and source code give no indication of this. I'm quite sure it isn't my evaluation method, as everything was fixed after the <code>del model</code> was added. I'm at a loss here... Are these runs actually independent, or is each call to <code>Word2Vec(foo, ...)</code> equivalent to retraining the previous model with <code>foo</code> as new data?</p>
<p>And before you ask, no <code>model</code> is nowhere outside of the scope of the <code>encode_sentence</code> variable; that's the only time that variable name is used in the whole program. Very odd.</p>
<h3>Edit with more details</h3>
<hr />
<p>If it's important, I'm using Word2Vec to build node embeddings on a graph the way Node2Vec does with different walk strategies. These embeddings are then fed to a Logistic Regression model (<code>evaluate(X)</code>) and which calculates area under the roc.</p>
<p>Here is some sample output of the model before adding the <code>del model</code> call to the <code>encode_sentences</code> method averaged over 5 trials:</p>
<pre><code>Random walks:   0.9153 (+/-) 0.002
Policy walks:   0.9125 (+/-) 0.005
E-greedy walks: 0.8489 (+/-) 0.011
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the same output with the only difference being <code>del model</code> in the encoding method:</p>
<pre><code>Random walks:   0.8627 (+/-) 0.005
Policy walks:   0.8527 (+/-) 0.002
E-greedy walks: 0.8385 (+/-) 0.009
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in each case, the variance is very low (the +/- value is the standard error) but the difference between the two runs is almost a whole standard deviation. It seems odd that if each call to <code>Word2Vec</code> was truly independent that manually freeing the data structure would have such a large effect.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Added some more logs from Spark:</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong></p>

<p>gensim uses from <code>xml.etree.cElementTree import iterparse</code>, documentation <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, which might cause the problem. It actually expects file name or file containing the xml data. Can be RDD considered as file containing the xml data?</p>

From the paper:</p>

<pre><code>Assume we are provided with a word2vec embedding matrix
X ∈ Rd×n for a finite size vocabulary of n words. The 
ith column, xi ∈ Rd, represents the embedding of the ith
word in d-dimensional space. We assume text documents
are represented as normalized bag-of-words (nBOW) vectors,
d ∈ Rn. To be precise, if word i appears ci times in
the document, we denote di = ci/cj (for j=1 to n). An nBOW vector
d is naturally very sparse as most words will not appear in
any given document. (We remove stop words, which are
generally category independent.)

<p>Before I get into details, I just want to add that my data set comprehends roughly 4kk entries of data points.</p>

<p>I have two lists of tuples that I've get from a framework (<a href=""https://github.com/spotify/annoy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">annoy</a>) that calculates cosine similarity between a vector and every other vector in the dataset. The final format is like this:</p>

<pre><code>[(name1, cosine), (name2, cosine), ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Because of the algorithm, I have two of that lists with the same names (first value of the tuple) in it, but two different cosine similarities. What I have to do is to sum the cosines from both lists, and then order the array and get the top-N highest cosine values.</p>

<p>My issue is: is taking too long. My actual code for this implementation is as following:</p>

<pre><code>def topN(self, user, session):
    upref = self.m2vTN.get_user_preference(user)
    spref = self.sm2vTN.get_user_preference(session)

    # list of tuples 1
    most_su = self.indexer.most_similar(upref, len(self.m2v.wv.vocab))
    # list of tuples 2
    most_ss = self.indexer.most_similar(spref, len(self.m2v.wv.vocab))

    # concat both lists and add into a dict
    d       = defaultdict(int)      
    for l, v in (most_ss + most_su): 
        d[l] += v  


     # convert the dict into a list, and then sort it
    _list    = list(d.items())
    _list.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    return [x[0] for x in _list[:self.N]]
</code></pre>

<p>How do I make this code faster? I've tried using threads but I'm not sure if it will make it faster. Getting the lists is not the problem here, but the concatenation and sorting is.</p>

<p>To convert the above vectors into a numpy matrix, I use:</p>

<pre><code>scipy_csc_matrix = gensim.matutils.corpus2csc(corpus)

<p>I then convert the sparse numpy matrix to a full array:</p>

<pre><code>full_matrix = csc_matrix(scipy_csc_matrix).toarray()
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I output this to a file:</p>

<pre><code>with open('file.csv','wb') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(full_matrix)
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a matrix of binomial vectors, but I do not know which vector represents which word. Is there an accurate way of matching words to vectors?</p>

<p>I've tried parsing the dictionary to creative a list of words which I would glue to the above full_matrix. </p>

<pre><code>#Retrive dictionary
tokenIDs = dictionary.token2id

#Retrieve keys from dictionary and concotanate those to full_matrix
for key, value in tokenIDs.iteritems():

    dictlist.append(temp)

Keys = np.asarray(dictlist)

#Combine Keys and Matrix
labeled_full_matrix = np.concatenate((Keys, full_matrix), axis=1)

<p>However, this does not work. The word ids (Keys) are not matched to the appropriate vectors. </p>

<p>I am under the assumption a much simpler and more elegant approach is possible. But after some time, I haven't been able to find it. Maybe someone here can help, or point me to something fundamental I've missed.</p>

I am using Gensim v.3.7.1, and I have trained both word2vec and doc2vec models. The results of the latter outperform word2vec’s, but I’m having trouble performing efficient queries with my Doc2Vec model. This model uses the distributed bag of words implementation (dm = 0).</p>

<p>I used to infer similarity using the built in method <code>model.most_similar()</code>, but this was not possible once I started training with more data that the one I want to query against. That's to say, <strong>I want to find the most similar sentence among a subset of my training dataset</strong>. My quick fix to this was comparing the vector of the new sentence with every vector on my set using cosine similarity, but obviously this does not scale as I have to compute loads of embeddings and make a lot of comparisons.</p>

<p>Essentially, I identify a number of topics (5 in the code above – to be checked), and using the last line I assign each news article a score, which indicates the probability of an article being related to one of these topics. 
Now, I can only manually make a qualitative assessment of whether a given topic is related to a crisis, which is bit unfortunate.
What I would much rather do, is to tell the algorithm whether an article was published during a crisis and use this additional piece of information to identify both topics for my “crisis years” as well as for my “non-crisis-years”. Simply splitting my dataset to just consider topics for my “bads” (i.e. crisis years only) won’t work in my opinion, as I would still need to manually select which topics would actually be related to a crisis, and which topics would show up anyways (sports news, …). </p>

<p>So, is there a way to adapt the code to a) incorporate the information of “crisis” vs “non-crisis” and b) to automatically chose the optimal number of topics / words to optimize the predictive power of the model?</p>

<p>The first step is getting the vocabulary :</p>

<pre><code>model.build_vocab(train_corpus)

<p>It ends up in 90 minutes. Here is the logging info at the end of this process :</p>

<p>Then I train the model with an iterator class on the train corpus :</p>

<pre><code>model.train(train_corpus, total_examples=nb_rows, epochs=model.epochs)

<p>The last training logs are :</p>

It's not the first time I encounter this problem, even with much smaller train corpus. Usually, I relaunch the entire process (vocabulary setting and model training) and it goes on.</p>

<p>By now, to save time, I wish to NOT calculate again the vocabulary, getting in place the previously succesfully calculated one, and only try to train again the model. Is there a way to save the vocab part only of the model, then load it to train the model directly on train corpus ?</p>

  <p>Coherence Score:  0.28852857563541856</p>

<p>LDA gave scores without problem. Now I model the same bag of words with MALLET</p>

<pre><code># Building LDA Mallet Model
mallet_path = '~/mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet' # update this path
ldamallet = gensim.models.wrappers.LdaMallet(mallet_path, 
corpus=corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=id2word)

# Convert mallet to gensim type
mallet_model = 
gensim.models.wrappers.ldamallet.malletmodel2ldamodel(ldamallet)

# Compute Coherence Score
coherence_model_ldamallet = CoherenceModel(model=mallet_model, 
texts=data_words_trigrams, dictionary=id2word, coherence='c_v')
coherence_ldamallet = coherence_model_ldamallet.get_coherence()
print('\nCoherence Score: ', coherence_ldamallet)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coherence Score:  0.5994123896865993</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I ask for the Perplexity values and get below warnings and NaN value.</p>

<pre><code># Compute Perplexity
print('\nPerplexity: ', mallet_model.log_perplexity(corpus))
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>/app/app-py3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/gensim/models/ldamodel.py:1108:
  RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in multiply   score +=
  np.sum((self.eta - _lambda) * Elogbeta)</p>
  
  <p>Perplexity:  nan</p>
  
  <p>/app/app-py3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/gensim/models/ldamodel.py:1109:
  RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in subtract   score +=
  np.sum(gammaln(_lambda) - gammaln(self.eta))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize this is a very Gensim specific question and requires deeper knowledge of this function: 
     gensim.models.wrappers.ldamallet.malletmodel2ldamodel(ldamallet)</p>

<p>Hence I would appreciate any comment on warnings and the Gensim domain.</p>

I am under the impression that Lda reduces the data to two lower level matrices (ref: <a href=""https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/</a>) but I cannot seem to figure out how to access the term-topic matrix. The only reference I could find in gensim's documentation is for the .get_topics() attribute, however the format it provides makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to apply a transformation to retrieve the Document-topic matrix, like so:</p>

<pre><code>doc_topic_matrix = lda_model[doc_term_matrix]
</code></pre>

<p>so I am hoping that there is a similarly functional method to generate the topic-term matrix.</p>

<p>Ideally, output should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>         word1  word2  word3  word4  word5
topic_a   .12    .38    .07    .24    .19
topic_b   .41    .11    .04    .14    .30
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts on whether or not this is possible?</p>

<p>And so my question is, how do i get all of the topics to print? I am unsure if this is a bug or an issue on my end. I have looked back at my library of LDA models (over 5000, different data sources), and have noted this happens in all of them where topics are above 20.</p>
<p>Below is sample code with output. In the output, you will see the topics are not ordered (they should be) and topics are missing such as topic 3.</p>

I tried to understand the meaning of the parameters within <code>LdaMulticore</code> and found the website that provides some explanations on the usage of the parameters.

I also referred some other materials from the website but I guess this page gives relatively full explanations of every parameters.

<li><code>chunksize</code>
Number of documents to be used in each training chunk.
<br>-&gt;Does it mean that it determines how many documents to be analyzed (trained) at once?
<br>Does changing the <code>chunksize</code> number generate significantly different outcomes? or does it just matter to the running time?</li>

<br>-&gt;I kept reading the explanations but couldn't understand these at all.
<br>Could someone give me some intuitive explanations on what these are about/when do I need to adjust these?</p>
<p>3.iteration
<br>Maximum number of iterations through the corpus when inferring the topic distribution of a corpus.
<br>-&gt;It seems that Python goes over n times of the entire corpus when I set it to n. So the higher the number, the more data is analyzed but takes longer time.</p>
<p>4.random state
<br>Either a <code>randomState</code> object or a seed to generate one. Useful for reproducibility.

For any given sentence that is not present in the sentences array (i.e. the set over which I trained the model), I need to update the model with that sentence so that querying it next time gives out some results. I am doing it like this:</p>

<pre><code>new_sentence = ['moscow', 'weather', 'cold']
model.train(new_sentence)
</code></pre>

<p>and its printing this as logs:</p>

<pre><code>2014-03-01 16:46:58,061 : INFO : training model with 1 workers on 98892 vocabulary and 100 features

<p>Now, when I query with similar new_sentence for most positives (as <code>model.most_similar(positive=new_sentence)</code>) it gives out error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

  KeyError: ""word 'cold' not in vocabulary""
</code></pre>

<p>Which indicates that the word 'cold' is not part of the vocabulary over which i trained the thing (am I right)?</p>

<p>So the question is: How to update the model so that it gives out all the possible similarities for the given new sentence?</p>

<p>I found that when I use a small number of topics to derive the model, Gensim yields a full report of topical distribution over all potential topics for a test document. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>test_lda = LdaModel(corpus,num_topics=5, id2word=id2word)
test_lda[dictionary.doc2bow('human system')]

(4, 0.10239641196758137)]
</code></pre>

<p>However when I use a large number of topics, the report is no longer complete:</p>

<pre><code>test_lda = LdaModel(corpus,num_topics=100, id2word=id2word)

test_lda[dictionary.doc2bow('human system')]
Out[315]: [(73, 0.50499999999997613)]
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that topics with a probability less than some threshold (I observed 0.01 to be more specific) are omitted form the output.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if this behaviour is due to some aesthetic considerations? And how can I get the distribution of the probability mass residual over all other topics?</p>

<p>However, the result which I am getting is 22% accuracy.</p>

<p>This makes me a lot suspicious especially because by using the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> instead of the <code>Doc2Vec</code> (both with the same classifier) then I am getting 88% accuracy (!).</p>

<p>Therefore, I guess that I must be doing something wrong in how I apply the <code>Doc2Vec</code> of <code>Gensim</code>.</p>

<p>What is it and how can I fix it?</p>

<p>Or it it simply that my dataset is relatively small while more advanced methods such as word embeddings etc require way more data?</p>

<p>So we can try from the supplied demo script:</p>

<p>Please note that <code>paris france berlin</code> is the input hint the demo suggest. The problem is that I'm unable to reproduce this behavior if I open the same word vectors in <code>Gensim</code> and try to compute the vectors myself. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(BIGDATA, binary=True)

I followed their installation instructions as said <a href=""http://nlp.fi.muni.cz/projekty/gensim/install.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, though installation of <code>scipy</code> on my OpenSuse 11.3 failed when using <code>easy_install</code> as they recommend, so I resorted to installing it from a package available on the Official package search portal <a href=""http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=scipy&amp;baseproject=openSUSE:11.3&amp;lang=en&amp;exclude_debug=true"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Installation of <code>scipy</code> went ok, and then I used <code>easy_install</code> to install <code>gensim</code> as they recommend. Which also went ok.</p>

<p>Now, after installation, I attempted to run the very first example they give of using the package, which starts with a humble import statement as follows:</p>

<pre><code>from gensim import corpora, models, similarities
</code></pre>

<p>Lo! When I attempted to run that in my python interpreter, the dear thing crashed with <code>Segmentation Fault</code>! This is what happened:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from gensim import corpora, models, similarities
Segmentation fault
</code></pre>

<p>Someone save me, because I don't know where the error could possibly be coming from.</p>

<p>I understand the segfault usually is due to illegal memory access by a process, so could this be happening due to the import? or some error within <code>gensim</code>?</p>

<p>For more info, it is said that after installing the package it can be tested, so I did this to test my <code>gensim</code>, Lo! the same <code>Segmentation Fault</code>! Here is the ouput:</p>

<p>Ok, as requested in the comments, I did hook gdb to the interpreter, and then tried the import statement again, then this is what gdb gave when the segfault occurred again:</p>

<p>As the chart shows, The coherence score value is highest score at the value 10. But when i visualize it using the intertopic Distance maps i found the topics are crowded and the overlaps between the topics is huge. So i visualize it using 5 and 7 topics.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JBgZZ.jpg"" alt=""intertopic distance map"" /><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JBgZZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>
I am not sure which number of topics is better to choose.
My question is, How to choose the best coherence value. a scintfic reference recommendation will be a good help for me.<br />

<p>Taking the IMDB dataset as an example I find that I get a similar accuracy percentage using Doc2Vec (88%), <strong>however a far better result using a simple tfidf vectoriser with tri-grams for feature extraction (91%)</strong>. I think this is similar to Table 2 in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5335v7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Mikolov's 2015 paper</a>.</p>

<p>I thought that by using a bigger data-set this would change. So I re-ran my experiment using a breakdown of 1mill training and 1 mill test from <a href=""http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Unfortunately, in that case my tfidf vectoriser feature extraction method increased to 93% but doc2vec fell to 85%.</p>

<p><strong>I was wondering if this is to be expected and that others find tfidf to be superior to doc2vec even for a large corpus?</strong></p>

<pre><code>model = Doc2Vec(min_count=2, window=10, size=model_feat_size, sample=1e-4, negative=5, workers=cores)

<p>Whereas my tfidf vectoriser has 40,000 max features:</p>

<pre><code>vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features = 40000, ngram_range = (1, 3), sublinear_tf = True)
</code></pre>

Now that I have the topic distribution for each document, how can I compare how similar two documents are in topics? I would like to have a summary measure. For example, the following are the topic distributions of two documents. There are totally 75 topics. For brevity, I show only the first 10 topics with largest probabilities (so the topics are not in order). (40, 0.5523168) means that topic #40 has a probability of 0.5523168 for DOC #1. Should I calculate the Euclidean or Cosine distance between the two vectors? And using this summary measure, can I say that, for example, DOC 1 is more similar to DOC2 than to DOC3, or DOC1 and DOC 2 are more similar to each other than DOC 3 and DOC 4 topically? Thank you!</p>

<ul>
<li>2-word context window, PMI weighting, no compression, 300K dimensions</li>

<p>What is the gensim equivalence when i train a Word2Vec model?</p>

<p>Is it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; model = Word2Vec(sentences, size=300000, window=2, min_count=5, workers=4)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Is there a PMI weight option in gensim?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is the default min_count used in word2vec?</strong></p>

<p>There's another set of parameters from word2vec as such:</p>

<ul>
<li>5-word context window, 10 negative samples, subsampling, 400 dimensions.</li>

Background Content: ANDERSON INITIAL DECISIONOn January 13, 2015, the appellant filed this appeal arguing that the agency's decision not to renew his term limited appointment which expired on January 28, 2015, is in error.  

 For the reasons discussed below, this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction without a hearing.
1
There is nothing in the agreement that curtails the agency's ability not to extend the term appointment. 
 IdIn reviewing the appellant's arguments, the appellant fails to establish that the Board has jurisdiction to review the agency's decision not to renew his time-limited appointment at issue in this appeal.
 Following a review of the record evidence, I find that the appellant has failed to non-frivolously allege Board jurisdiction over this appeal on any basis.
 Accordingly, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[self-governance|self-governed]] societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as [[stateless society|stateless societies]],&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&amp;quot; George Woodcock. &amp;quot;Anarchism&amp;quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&amp;quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &amp;quot;Anarchism&amp;quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;Anarchism.&amp;quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &amp;quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;&amp;quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&amp;quot; Judith Suissa.

"31821821","1","","","2015-08-05 01:06:27","","6","9165","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to judge whether a phrase is semantically related to other words found in a corpus using Gensim.  For example, here is the corpus document pre-tokenized:</p>

<pre><code> **Corpus**
 Car Insurance
 Car Insurance Coverage
 Auto Insurance
 Best Insurance
 How much is car insurance
 Best auto coverage
 Auto policy
 Car Policy Insurance
</code></pre>

<p>My code (based on <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/tut3.html#similarity-interface"" rel=""noreferrer"">this gensim tutorial</a>) judges the semantic relatendness of a phrase using cosine similarity against all strings in corpus.  </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>It seems that if a query contains ANY of the terms found within my dictionary, that phrase is judged as being semantically similar to the corpus (e.g.  **Giraffe Poop Car Murderer has a cosine similarity of 1 but SHOULD be semantically unrelated).  I am not sure how to solve for this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong></p>

<pre><code>#Tokenize Corpus and filter out anything that is a stop word or has a frequency &lt;1
texts = [[word for word in document if word not in stoplist]
        for document in documents]
from collections import defaultdict
frequency = defaultdict(int)
for text in texts:
    for token in text:
        frequency[token] += 1
texts = [[token for token in text if frequency[token] &gt; 1]
        for text in texts]
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)

# doc2bow counts the number of occurences of each distinct word, converts the word
# to its integer word id and returns the result as a sparse vector

corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]  
lsi = models.LsiModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=2)
doc = ""giraffe poop car murderer""
vec_bow = dictionary.doc2bow(doc.lower().split())

#convert the query to LSI space
vec_lsi = lsi[vec_bow]              
index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(lsi[corpus])

# perform a similarity query against the corpus
sims = index[vec_lsi]
sims = sorted(enumerate(sims), key=lambda item: -item[1])

So what it suggested here is to set a fixed seed in order to get same results every time. Why however am I getting for every topic the same probability?</p>

<p>What I want to do is to find for every twitter user her topics and  calculate the similarity between twitter users based on similarities in topics. Is there any possibility to calculate the same topics for every user in gensim or do I have to calculate a dictionary of topics and cluster every user topic?</p>

<p>In general, which is the best way to compare two twitter users based on topic-models extraction in gensim? My code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>   def preprocess(id): #Returns user word list (or list of user tweet)

        user_list =  user_corpus(id, 'user_'+str(id)+'.txt')
        documents = []
        for line in open('user_'+str(id)+'.txt'):
                 documents.append(line)
        #remove stop words
        lines = [line.rstrip() for line in open('stoplist.txt')]
        stoplist= set(lines)  
        texts = [[word for word in document.lower().split() if word not in stoplist]
                   for document in documents]
        # remove words that appear only once
        all_tokens = sum(texts, [])
        tokens_once = set(word for word in set(all_tokens) if all_tokens.count(word) &lt; 3)
        texts = [[word for word in text if word not in tokens_once]
                   for text in texts]
        words = []
        for text in texts:
            for word in text:
                words.append(word)

        return words


    words1 = preprocess(14937173)

</code></pre>

<p>In the case where I use a list of user tweets, I get back calculated topics for every tweet.</p>

<p>Question 2: Does the following make sense: training LDA model with several twitter users and calculating the topic for every user (with every user corpus), using the LDA model calculated before?</p>

<p>In provided example, <code>list[0]</code> returns topic distribution with equal probabilities 0.1. 
Basically, every line of text corresponds to a different tweet. If I calculate corpus with <code>corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]</code> it will give me the probabilities for every tweet separately. On the other hand, if I use <code>corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(words)]</code> like the example, I'll have just all user words as corpus. In the second case, gensim returns the same probabilities for all topics. Thus, for both users I am getting the same topic distributions.</p>

<p>Should user text corpus be a list of words or a list of sentences (a list of tweets)?</p>

<p>Regarding the implementation of Qi He and Jianshu Weng in <a href=""http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1503&amp;context=sis_research"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">twitterRank approach</a> in page 264 it says that: we aggregate the tweets published by individual twitterer into a big document. Thus, each document corresponds to a twitterer. Ok I am confused, if document will be all user tweets then what should the corpus contain??</p>

Here is my story: I am trying to learn using doc2vec 2.4 million documents. At first, I tried only doing so with a small model of 12 documents. I checked the results with infer vector of the first document and found it to be similar indeed to the first document by 0.97-0.99 cosine similarity measure. Which I found good, even though when I tried to enter a new document of completely different words I received a high score of 0.8 measure similarity. However, I had put it aside and tried to go on and build the full model with the 2.4 million documents. In this point, my problems began. The result was complete nonsense, I received in the most_similar function results with a similarity of 0.4-0.5 which were completely different from the new document checked. I tried to tune parameters but no result yet. I tried also to remove randomness both from the small and big model, however, I still got different vectors. Then I had tried to use get_latest_training_loss on each epoch in order to see how the loss changes over each epoch. This is my code: </p>

<pre><code>model = Doc2Vec(vector_size=300, alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.025, pretrained_emb="".../glove.840B.300D/glove.840B.300d.txt"", seed=1, workers=1, compute_loss=True)

workers=1, compute_loss=True)
model.build_vocab(documents)

for epoch in range(10):
    for i in range(model_glove.epochs):
        model.train(documents, total_examples = token_count, epochs=1)
        training_loss = model.get_latest_training_loss()
        print(""Training Loss: "" + str(training_loss))

    model.alpha -= 0.002  # decrease the learning rate
    model.min_alpha = model.alpha # fix the learning rate, no decay
</code></pre>

<p>I know this code is a bit awkward, but it is used here only to follow the loss. 
The error I receive is: </p>

<pre><code>AttributeError: 'Doc2Vec' object has no attribute 'get_latest_training_loss'
</code></pre>

<p>I tried looking at model. and auto-complete and found that indeed there is no such function, I found something similar name training_loss, but it gives me the same error. </p>

<p>Anyone here can give me an idea? </p>

<p>So I'm wondering i'm able to save the resulting topics that it generated, to a readable format. I've tried the <code>.save()</code> methods, but it always outputs something unreadable. </p>

<p>I have created a set of word pairs, were in each pair, the first entry is the word from the source model and the second entry is its equivalent from the target model, as follows (think of them as standard stop word list since my goal is not to learn a mapping between embedding spaces NOT of two different languages, but rather embedding spaces of the same language in different times):</p>
<pre><code>word_pairs = [
    (&quot;w11&quot;, &quot;w12&quot;), (&quot;w21&quot;, &quot;w22&quot;), (&quot;w31&quot;, &quot;w32&quot;), etc

<p>My question is that, after learning the mapping, when we want to get the vector of the representative of word w_i from embedding space V_i (1967 in this example) in embedding space V_j (1990 in this example) should I do:</p>
<pre><code>trans_model.translate(w_i, topn=1) 
</code></pre>
<p>or should I do the matrix-vector multiplication (which will result in a vector; given that, for example, the translation matrix is 300 by 300 and the vector is 300 by 1 resulting in a new 300 by 1):</p>
<pre><code>trans_model.dot(source_model.wv[w_i])

<p>On my company, we have a list of phrases that we cluster manually after filtering them with a script that uses the Damerau-Levenshtein distance formula (actually, this data is on Elasticsearch and we use the fuzzyness search and the score to understand if the matching should be considered).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>PHP Developer</code> is in the cluster <code>Developer</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say there is <code>Java Developer</code>, this too should be clustered as <code>Developer</code>.</p>

<p>The fuzzy search of Elasticsearch matches <code>Java Developer</code> to be similar to <code>PHP Developer</code> (Elasticsearch uses the Damerau-Levenshtein distance formula) so the script considers to put the same clusters of <code>PHP Developer</code> that are already validated (this validation is done manually).</p>

<p>My question is: can this gensim be useful to cluster words using Wikipedia's database as a ""dictionary""? </p>

<p>I also find this <a href=""https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md?utm_campaign=buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer0df9b&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pre-trained vectors</a> done by Facebook, I don't know if I can use this for my problem.</p>

<p>I wonder what pattern is in the vectors making that possible. I thought it should be similarity of vectors making that somehow possible. Gensim similarity measures rely on cosine similarity. Therefore, I tried the following:</p>

<p>Randomly initialised a fix “compare” vector, get cosine similarity of the “compare” vector with all other vectors in training and test set, use the similarities and the labels of the train set to estimate a logistic regression model, evaluate the model with the test set.</p>

<p>Looks like this, where train/test_arrays contain document vectors and train/test_labels labels either 0 or 1. (Notice, document vectors are obtained from genism doc2vec and are well trained, predicting the test set 80% right if directly used as input for the logistic regression):</p>

<pre><code>fix_vec = numpy.random.rand(100,1)
def cos_distance_to_fix(x):
    return scipy.spatial.distance.cosine(fix_vec, x)

train_arrays_cos =  numpy.reshape(numpy.apply_along_axis(cos_distance_to_fix, axis=1, arr=train_arrays), newshape=(-1,1))
test_arrays_cos = numpy.reshape(numpy.apply_along_axis(cos_distance_to_fix, axis=1, arr=test_arrays), newshape=(-1,1))

classifier = LogisticRegression()
classifier.fit(train_arrays_cos, train_labels)
classifier.score(test_arrays_cos, test_labels)
</code></pre>

<p>It turns out, that this approach does not work, predicting the test set only to 50%....
So, my question is, what “information” is in the vectors, making the prediction based on vectors work, if it is not the similarity of vectors? Or is my approach simply not possible to capture similarity of vectors correct?</p>

    LDA N is the transformation of DOC N by that LDA model</p>

<p>Am I correct in understanding the output for each transformed document ""LDA N"" to be the topics that the document N belongs to? By that understanding, I can see some documents like 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 to belong to more than 1 topic like DOC 8 belongs to topics 12, 19, 22 and 28 with the respective probabilities.</p>

<p>For example,

<p>However if I print <code>print(model.docvecs.doctags)</code> I see things like this:
<code>'4_99.txt_3': Doctag(offset=1644, word_count=12, doc_count=1)</code></p>

<p>So it appears that for every document, <code>doc2vec</code> is saving each sentence as the ""document name underscore number""</p>

A) training incorrectly or

I would like to use that model to infer the vectors of another document, which I want to use as the corpus for comparison. So, when I look for the most similar sentence to one I introduce, it uses this new document vectors instead of the trained corpus.
Currently, I am using the <code>infer_vector()</code> to compute the vector for each one of the sentences of the new document, but I can't use the <code>most_similar()</code> function with the list of vectors I obtain, it has to be <code>KeyedVectors</code>.</p>

<p>I would like to know if there's any way that I can compute these vectors for the new document that will allow the use of the <code>most_similar()</code> function, or if I have to compute the similarity between each one of the sentences of the new document and the sentence I introduce individually (in this case, is there any implementation in Gensim that allows me to compute the cosine similarity between 2 vectors?).</p>

<p>I try to compute the vectors for the new document this way:</p>

<pre><code>questions = [doc2vec_model.infer_vector(line) for line in lines_4]
</code></pre>

<p>And then I try to compute the similarity between the new document vectors and an input phrase:</p>

tokens = text.split()

<li>Is my tf implementation of Doc2Vec correct. Basically is it supposed to be concatenating the word vectors and the document vector to predict the middle word in a certain context?</li>

<li>Any insights as to why Gensim is performing better? Is my model any different to how they implement it?</li>

<p>I would like to use gensim's <code>word2vec</code> on a custom data set, but now I'm still figuring out in what format the dataset has to be. I had a look at <a href=""http://streamhacker.com/2014/12/29/word2vec-nltk/"">this post</a> where the input is basically a list of lists (one big list containing other lists that are tokenized sentences from the NLTK Brown corpus).

<p><strong>This worked</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models import word2vec
from nltk.corpus import brown

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

vocab = [s.encode('utf-8').split() for s in sentences]
voc_vec = word2vec.Word2Vec(vocab)

<p>I don't understand why it doesn't work with the ""mock"" data, even though it has the same data structure as the sentences from the Brown corpus:</p>

<p><strong>vocab</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>[['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dogs'], ['yoyoyo', 'you', 'go', 'home', 'now', 'to', 'sleep']]

<p>I have trained a gensim doc2vec model using the corpus(10k sentences) I have. This model can to some extend tell me if a new sentence is similar to some of the sentences in the corpus. 
But, there is a problem: it may happen that there are words in new sentences which don't exist in the corpus, which means that they don't have a word embedding. If this happens, the prediction result will not be good. 
As far as I know, the trained doc2vec model does have a matrix of doc vectors as well as a matrix of word vectors. So what I were thinking is to load a set of pre-trained word vectors, which contains a large number of words, and then train the model to get the doc vectors. Does it make sense?

<p>I know that in general I can just get the embeddings for each document directly from gensim model but I want to fine-tune the embedding layer in keras later on, since doc embeddings will be used as a part of a larger task hence they might be fine-tuned a bit.</p>

<p>So far so good. But I want to use lda_model to predict text. I at least need to know topic distribution over text and all the topic-word relation. </p>

<p>I think prediction is very common and important function for lda. But I do not know where I can find such function in gensim. Some answers says doc_lda = model[doc_bow] is prediction (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40924185/calculating-topic-distribution-of-an-unseen-document-on-gensim"">Calculating topic distribution of an unseen document on GenSim</a>).

<p>I'm trying to use LDA Gensim to extract topics from a list of text documents. </p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models import LdaModel
from gensim.corpora import Dictionary
</code></pre>

<p>I build <code>dictionary</code> and <code>corpus</code>:</p>

<pre><code>dictionary = Dictionary(final_docs)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in final_docs]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>final_docs</code> is a list of lists with cleaned tokens for each text like this: </p>

<pre><code>final_docs = [['cat','dog','animal'],['school','university','education'],...['music','dj','pop']]
</code></pre>

<p>then I initiate the model like this:</p>

<pre><code># Set training parameters:
num_topics = 60
chunksize = 100
passes = 20
iterations = 400
eval_every = None 

# Make an index to word dictionary
temp = dictionary[0]  # This is only to ""load"" the dictionary.
id2word = dictionary.id2token

model = LdaModel(corpus=corpus, id2word=id2word, chunksize=chunksize, \
                           alpha='auto', eta='auto', \
                           iterations=iterations, num_topics=num_topics, \
                           passes=passes, eval_every=eval_every)
</code></pre>

<p>I can print topics and terms (10 most important). And they make sense. So it seems working fine.</p>

<pre><code>for idx in range(n_topics):
    print(""Topic #%s:"" % idx, model.print_topic(idx, 10))
</code></pre>

<p>BUT I struggle to plot all the documents as clusters using Bokeh. (And I really need Bokeh because I compare the same plot from different models). I know I have to reduce dimensionality to 2. And I try to do it using CountVectorizer and then T-sne:</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
docs_vect = [' '.join(txt) for txt in final_docs]
cvectorizer = CountVectorizer(min_df=6, max_df=0.50, max_features=10000, stop_words=stop)
cvz = cvectorizer.fit_transform(docs_vect)
X_lda = model.fit_transform(cvz)
</code></pre>

<p>But I get this error: <code>AttributeError: 'LdaModel' object has no attribute 'fit_transform'</code>
I'm definitely doing something wrong with CountVectorizer. Could anyone help me out?</p>

<p>However, I am not sure what is the best preprocessing for this corpus.</p>

<p><code>gensim</code> model accepts a list of tokenized sentences.
My first try is to just use the standard <code>WikipediaCorpus</code> preprocessor from <code>gensim</code>. This extract each article, remove punctuation and split words on spaces. With this tool each sentence would correspond to an entire model, and I am not sure of the impact of this fact on the model.</p>

<p>After this I train the model with default parameters. Unfortunately after training it seems that I do not manage to obtain very meaningful similarities.</p>

<p>What is the most appropriate preprocessing on the Wikipedia corpus for this task? (if this questions are too broad please help me by pointing to a relevant tutorial / article )</p>

<p>I can store them in any format on the disk, before I build a stream to pass them to gensim's word2vec function. </p>

<p>What format would be best, and why?  The most important criterion would be performance vis-a-vis training (which will take many days), but coherent structure to the filesystem would also be nice.  </p>

<p>Would it be crazy to store several million or maybe even a few billion text files containing one sentence each?  Or perhaps some sort of database?  If this was numerical data I'd use hdf5.  But it's text.  The cleanest would be to store them in the original data frames, but that seems less ideal from an i/o perspective, because I'd have to load each data frame (largish) every epoch.  </p>

<p>Using the same training data and equivalent parameters, I get meaningful results with Facebook's FastText. In comparison, I've tried the Gensim FastText and Word2Vec classes, both returning meaningless embeddings.</p>
<p>To narrow things down, here are some of the settings:</p>

<li>30GB training data text file. Space separated tokens, newline separated sentences.</li>

<p>I would rather avoid using Facebook's FastText as it would require me changing its source code to achieve this vocab size.</p>

<p>I think I may represent a special use case because the ""sentences"" have arbitrary strings rather than dictionary words. Each sentence (line) has about 100 words and each ""word"" has about 20 characters, with characters like <code>""/""</code> and also numbers.</p>

<p>The training code is very simple:</p>

<pre><code># as shown in http://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/
import gensim, logging, os

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

    def __init__(self, dirname):
        self.dirname = dirname

    def __iter__(self):
        for fname in os.listdir(self.dirname):
            for line in open(os.path.join(self.dirname, fname)):
                yield line.split()

current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

# each line represents a full chess match
input_dir = current_dir+""/../fen_output""
output_file = current_dir+""/../learned_vectors/output.model.bin""

sentences = MySentences(input_dir)

model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences,workers=8)
</code></pre>

<p>Thing is, things work real quick up to 100K sentences (my RAM steadily going up) but then I run out of RAM and I can see my PC has started swapping, and training grinds to a halt. I don't have a lot of RAM available, only about 4GB and <code>word2vec</code> uses up all of it before starting to swap.</p>

<p>I think I have OpenBLAS correctly linked to numpy: this is what <code>numpy.show_config()</code> tells me:</p>

<pre><code>blas_info:
  libraries = ['blas']
  library_dirs = ['/usr/lib']

<p>My question is: <strong>is this expected on a machine that hasn't got a lot of available RAM (like mine) and I should get more RAM or train the model in smaller pieces?</strong> or <strong>does it look like my setup isn't configured properly (or my code is inefficient)?</strong></p>

<p>However, I'm having trouble getting DBSCAN to output meaningful results. It seems to label almost everything in the ""0"" group (colored teal in the images). As I increase epsilon, the ""0"" group takes over everything. Here are screenshots with epsilon=10, and epsilon=12.5. With epsilon=20, almost everything is in the same group.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9QvG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e9QvG.png"" alt=""epsilon 10""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LLkzu.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LLkzu.png"" alt=""epsilon 12.5""></a></p>

<p>I would expect, for instance, the group of ""clothing"" words to all get clustered together (they're unclustered @ eps=10). I would also expect more on the order of 100 clusters, as opposed to 5 - 12 clusters, and to be able to control the size and number of the clusters using epsilon.</p>

<p>A few questions, then. Am I understanding the use of DBSCAN correctly? Is there another clustering algorithm that might be a better choice? How can I know what a good clustering algorithm for my data is?</p>

<p>Is it safe to assume my model is tuned pretty well, given that the TSNE looks about right?</p>

<p>What other techniques can I use in order to isolate the issue with clustering? How do I know if it's my word2vec model, my use of DBSCAN, or something else?</p>

<p>Here's the code I'm using to perform DBSCAN:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import gensim
import json
from optparse import OptionParser

import numpy as np
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# snip option parsing

model = gensim.models.Word2Vec.load(options.file);
words = sorted(model.vocab.keys())
vectors = StandardScaler().fit_transform([model[w] for w in words])

db = DBSCAN(eps=options.epsilon).fit(vectors)
labels = db.labels_
core_indices = db.core_sample_indices_

n_clusters = len(set(labels)) - (1 if -1 in labels else 0)
print(""Estimated {:d} clusters"".format(n_clusters), file=sys.stderr)

output = [{'word': w, 'label': np.asscalar(l), 'isCore': i in core_indices} for i, (l, w) in enumerate(zip(labels, words))]
print(json.dumps(output))

For this, I need to use word embedding for OCRed output. I have several different options for the embedding (Google's word2vec, Stanford's, Facebook's FastText) but my main concern is OOV words, as the OCR output will have a lot of misspelled words. For example, I want the embeddings such that the output for <strong>Embedding</strong> and <strong>Embdding</strong> (e missed by the OCR) should have a certain level of similarity. I don't care much about the associated contextual information. </p>

<p>I chose Facebook's FastText as it gives the embeddings for OOV words as well. My only concern is the size of the embeddings. The vector size of the FastText's model is of length 300. Is there a way to reduce the size of the returned word vector(I am thinking of using PCA or any other dimensionality reduction technique, but given the size of word vectors, it can be a time-consuming task)? </p>

<p><strong>I am confused by the Gensim implementation of Doc2vec</strong>.</p>
<p>The process that works in R goes like this:</p>
<p><strong>Offline</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><p>Word vectors are trained using the functions in the <code>text2vec</code> package, namely GloVe or GlobalVectors, on a large corpus This gives me a large Word Vector text file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Before the ML step takes place, the <code>Doc2Vec</code> function from the <code>TextTinyR</code> library is used to turn each piece of text from a smaller, more specific training corpus into a vector. <em>This is not a machine learning step. No model is trained</em>. The Doc2Vec function effectively aggregates the word vectors in the sentence, in the same sense that finding the sum or mean of vectors does, but in a way that preserves information about word order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Various models are then trained on these smaller text corpuses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>The new text is converted to Document Vectors using the pretrained word vectors.</li>
<li>The Document Vectors are fed into the pretrained model to obtain the output classification.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>The example code I have found for Gensim appears to be a radical departure from this.</strong></p>
<p>It appears in <code>gensim</code> that Doc vectors are a separate class of model from word vectors that you can train. It seems in some cases, the word vectors and doc vectors are all trained at once. Here are some examples from tutorials and stackoverflow answers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ignores all words with total frequency lower than this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the effect of min_count on the context? Lets say that I have a sentence of frequent words (min_count > 5) and infrequent words (min_count &lt; 5), annotated with f and i:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This (f) is (f) a (f) test (i) sentence (i) which (f) is (f) shown (i) here (i)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just made up which word is frequently used and which word is not for demonstration purposes.</p>

<p>If I remove all infrequent words, we get a completely different context from which word2vec is trained. In this example, your sentence would be ""This is a which is"", which would then be a training sentence for Word2Vec. Moreover, if you have a lot of infrequent words, words that were originally very far away from each other are now placed within the same context.</p>

<p>Is this the correct interpretation of Word2Vec? Are we just assuming that you shouldn't have too many infrequent words in your dataset (or set a lower min_count threshold)?</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS</strong>: Someone understand how Gensim functions works and can find the logic in it?</p>
<p>a) If I use Multicore is slower than single core.</p>
<p>b) And if I use  <code>.ldamodel.LdaModel</code> I get also another result than using only <code>.LdaModel</code> (and the same relation is applied for Multicore).</p>
<p>Many thanks to the community!</p>

However I am having trouble on how to implement it.</p>
<p>The github link above, will take one vector file and retrofitting it, output another vector file. I can load it using gensim library. However, since it is a vector file, it is no longer a model and it will not predict OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words. This makes it pointless. Is there a way to retrain the model somehow so it has better accuracy?</p>

<p>I want to train a Word2Vec/Doc2Vec model with the package <code>gensim</code> based on the entries of one column in the data frame, that's why I built an iterator like in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56681210/convert-a-column-in-a-dask-dataframe-to-a-taggeddocument-for-doc2vec"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>Now, <code>gensim</code> trains using multiple cores whose number I need to specify, and similarly <code>dask</code> allows me to use multiple cores, too. So far I gave all available cores to <code>dask</code> and the same number of cores to <code>gensim</code>. My reasoning would be that fetching data and training on the data are exclusive tasks that cannot be done at the same time, so <code>gensim</code> and <code>dask</code> shouldn't fight over the cores.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are no error messages, but still, training seems to be quite slow, and I suspect there's a better way to distribute the work. Does anyone have experience in this matter?</p>

<p>This last line returns <code>False</code>. I am working with gensim 3.8.3 and Python 3.5.2. More generally, is there <em>any</em> role that the values of the tags play (assuming they are unique)? I ask because I have found that using different tags for documents in a classification task leads to widely varying performance.</p>

<p>Note:
Those files not exists in the directory,
The model run on a server and download the model file from the storage
My question is, Do the model must have those files for inference?
I want to run it as low memory consumption as possible.
Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Is the file model.trainables.syn1neg.npy is the model weights?
Is the file model.wv.vectors.npy is necessary for running an inference? </p>

I do not understand how increasing the number of epochs could lead to lower the performance.
It seems not to be a misunderstanding from the function <code>get_latest_training_loss</code> since I observe the results with the function <code>most_similar</code> way better with only 1 epoch :</p>

I was able to download the model from s3 to /tmp/ and it did authorize and retrieve the model file, but it went out of space [file is ~2GB, /tmp/ is 512MB]</p>

<p>so, switched to directly loading the model by gensim as above and now getting that mysterious error.</p>

<p>running the function with python-lambda-local works without issues </p>

<p>This method is working and I can get results from it, but I would like to know if there is a different way of training to achieve better results. Currently I am just training many models with different epochs and vector_sizes, then using the infer_vector and most_similar functions to see if the vector score returned from the most_similar entry is greater than a certain number, but is there a way to improve upon this in the aspect of training the model?</p>

<p>Also, aiming to get better results I trained another model in the same way with a larger data-set (100k+ entries). When I used this model on the same data-set it produced similar but worse results to the models trained on smaller data-sets. I thought that more training data would have improved the results not made them worse, does anyone know a reason for this ?</p>

<p>Also, to further test I created a new but bigger test-set (15k entries) which did even worse then the original test-set. The data in this test-set although being unique is the same type of data used in the original test-set yet produces worse results, what may be the reason for this ?</p>

<p>I am starting to work with word embedding and found a great amount of information about it. I understand, this far, that I can train my own word vectors or use previously trained ones, such as Google's or Wikipedia's, which are available for the English language and aren't useful to me, since I am working with texts in <em>Brazilian Portuguese</em>. Therefore, I went on a hunt for pre-trained word vectors in Portuguese and I ended up finding <a href=""http://ahogrammer.com/2017/01/20/the-list-of-pretrained-word-embeddings/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hirosan's List of Pretrained Word Embeddings</a> which led me to Kyubyong's <a href=""https://github.com/Kyubyong/wordvectors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WordVectors</a> from which I learned about Rami Al-Rfou's <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/rmyeid/projects/polyglot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Polyglot</a>. After downloading both, I unsuccessfully have been trying to simply load the word vectors.</p>

<p><strong>Short Description</strong></p>

<p>I can't load pre-trained word vectors; I am trying <a href=""https://github.com/Kyubyong/wordvectors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WordVectors</a> and <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/rmyeid/projects/polyglot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Polyglot</a>.</p>

As pointed out by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/50579950?noredirect=1"">Aneesh Joshi</a>, the correct way to load Kyubyong's model is by calling the native load function of Word2Vec.</p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models import Word2Vec
kyu_path = '.../pre-trained_word_vectors/kyubyong_pt/pt.bin'
model = Word2Vec.load(kyu_path)
</code></pre>

<p>Even though I am more than grateful for Aneesh Joshi solution, polyglot seems to be a better model for working with Portuguese. Any ideas about that one?</p>

It will take us forever, so I figured I would at least try to summarize the documents with Gensim, extract some keywords, and write the file name, summary, and keywords to a CSV. I'm doing this in the latest Jupyter Notebook using the Python 3 kernel.</p>

<p>I'm a python newbie, but I've done this in the past by looping through the directory and haven't had an issue.</p>

<p>This time after about 2 or so hours, the memory utilization starts creeping up to around 12GB and stays there for about an hour then returns down to normally fluctuationg between 100-300MB. Then an hour or two later the memory jumps back up and stays there and doesn't seem to process any more files...I left it running for 24 hours.  Being new to Python I'm not familiar with how to debug this and I'm not sure if it is because of my loop, some type of file encoding issues, or just a corrupt file or two in general.</p>

<p>This is a sparse matrix representation, and from what I understand other libraries represent the document-term matrix in a similar fashion as well. If the document-term matrix is non-sparse (meaning the zero entries are there as well), I know that I just have to (A.T*A), since A is of dimension (num. of documents by num. of terms), so multiplying the two will give the term co-occurrences. Ultimately, I want to get the top n co-occurrences (so get the top n term pairs that occur together in the same texts). How would I achieve this? I am not attached to Gensim for creating the BOW model. If another library like sklearn can do it more easily, I am very open. I would appreciate any advice/help/code with this problem -- thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The  corpora  were  lemmatized and POS-tagged with the Stanford CoreNLP (Manning  et  al.,  2014)  and  each  token  was  replaced with its lemma and POS tag</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why does the first paper apply POS-tagging? Would each token then be replaced with something like <code>{lemma}_{POS}</code> and the whole thing used to train the model? Or are the tags used to filter tokens? 
For example, gensims WikiCorpus applies lemmatization per default and then only keeps a few types of part of speech (verbs, nouns, etc.) and gets rid of the rest. So what is the recommended way?</p></li>
<li><p>The quote from the second paper seems to me like they only split up words and then lowercase them. This is also what I first tried before I used WikiCorpus. In my opinion, this should give better results for document embeddings as most of POS types contribute to the meaning of a sentence. Am I right?</p></li>

I am aware that there are various options for setting the hyper-parameters $\alpha$ and $\eta$, including 'symmetric' and 'auto.' Choosing 'auto' means that Gensim will use Newton-Raphson updates (as described in <a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Eblei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blei <em>et al.</em> (2003)</a> and <a href=""http://jonathan-huang.org/research/dirichlet/dirichlet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Huang</a>) in its variational inference algorithm to learn optimal values of that hyperparameter from the data. However, it seems that these updates are implemented only in the asymmetric dirichlet prior case - that is, where $\alpha$ and $\eta$ are vectors of length K (# of topics) and V (# of tokens in vocabulary) respectively rather than scalars. That is fine for $\alpha$, but I would like for the algorithm to use Newton-Raphson updates to learn a symmetric $\eta$ prior (this is recommended in <a href=""https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/papers/NIPS2009_0929.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wallach, Mimno, and McCallum</a>). Does anyone know if there is any way to do this in Gensim?</p>
<p>It seems to me that it should be possible in theory as I was able to derive symmetric case updates using the same approach used to derive the asymmetric case updates. If there is not a way to do this in Gensim, why not? Can anyone provide reasoning for why this feature would be unnecessary or undesirable?</p>
<p>An additional note: for either $\eta$ or $\alpha$ the 'symmetric' option sets the parameter equal to 1/K. In the case of $\eta$ for the V-word topics, this seems like a strange choice of default to me. As a secondary question, can anyone explain this choice?</p>

My model vocabulary is such that the top X are the word vectors I would like to <em>search through and return</em>, and indices X+1 and greater contain the words that I am searching <em>with</em>. I.e., when I search, I would not like to search through anything beyond index X.</p>
<p>I am using the restrict_vocab=X flag to only search through the top X of the vocab. I noticed that some of the nearest neighbors that are being returned are NOT from the top X and was wondering if anyone had any insights into what is going on here?</p>
<p>Specifically, I am using a version with an annoy indexer and a version without:</p>
<pre><code>neighbors = word_vec_model.most_similar(positive=[root_word], topn=N, restrict_vocab=X)
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>neighbors = word_vec_model.most_similar(positive=[root_word], topn=N, restrict_vocab=X, indexer=annoy_index)
</code></pre>
<p>I verified that a word vector that is being returned is greater than X by getting the index in the vocab:</p>
<pre><code>list(word_vec_model.vocab.keys()).index(returned_neighbor)
</code></pre>
<p>and saw that it was a number greater than X.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<pre><code>print(word_vec_model.vocab[returned_neighbor].index)
</code></pre>
<p>returned the same number as above.</p>
<p>I created my word_vec_model with the following line of code:</p>
<pre><code>word_vec_model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('embeddings.txt', binary=False)
</code></pre>
<p>where each line in the file is a keyword and a 512 dimensional vector. The file is formatted such that the first X are my <em>search through</em> words, and the X+1 and greater lines are the <em>search with</em> words. I expected the words to be read in in order and the .vocab attribute confirms this.</p>

I am currently using gensim, but can use other packages if necessary.</p>

<p>As an example, my text looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[
['apple', 'banana','carrot','dates', 'elderberry', ..., 'zucchini'],
['aluminium', 'brass','copper', ..., 'zinc'],
...
]
</code></pre>

<p>I intentionally want 'apple' to be considered as close to 'zucchini' as it is to 'banana' so I have set the window size to a very large number, say 1000.
I am aware of 2 problems that may arise with this.</p>

<p>Problem 1:
The window might <em>roll</em> in at the start of a sentence creating the following training pairs:
<code>('apple', ('banana')), ('apple', ('banana', 'carrot')), ('apple', ('banana', 'carrot', 'date'))</code> before it eventually gets to the correct <code>('apple', ('banana','carrot', ..., 'zucchini'))</code>.
This would seem to have the effect of making 'apple' closer to 'banana' than 'zucchini',
since their are so many more pairs containing 'apple' and 'banana' than there are pairs containing 'apple' and 'zucchini'.</p>

<p>Problem 2:
I heard that pairs are sampled with inverse proportion to the distance from the target word to the context word- This also causes an issue making nearby words more seem more connected than I want them to be.</p>

<p>Is there a way around problems 1 and 2?
Should I be using cbow as opposed to sgns? Are there any other hyperparameters that I should be aware of?
What is the best way to go about removing/ignoring the order in this case?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Firstly Using the example above, is it better to train the model using just documents related to sports or documents on all subjects. My thinking was by training just on sports documents you could classify documents based on document similarity(although this wouldnt produce vectors for non sports documents to use to train the next model). Also, i feel like if training the model on all documents you would need a huge amount of documents to represent everything other than sports to get good classification. </p></li>
<li><p>Secondly, which features are actually used to train the logistic regression model. If training the model on all documents I assume you would track the documents using an index of some sort and then train the logistic regression model using the vectors with a class label, is this correct ? </p></li>
<li><p>Thirdly, I have seen various uses of TaggedDocument where a unique id is put for each document and also where a shared id is used to represent the same class, eg., 1 = sports 0 = non sports. From what I have read a shared id means the model has a single vector representing each class, while using a unique id provides unique vectors for each document, is this correct ?. If so, assuming that I need unique labeled vectors for training the logistic regression model what is the point of using a shared id ? Wouldnt this provide terrible classification results ?</p></li>

The reason for doing this is that I would like to leverage Gensim, pyLDAvis, etc to display the results on some topic-word distribution that I obtain from other algorithms. </p>

<p>Is that possible? Below I show some incomplete code (because I find the ML community intimidating):</p>

<pre><code>import gensim
texts=[['a','a','b'], ['a','b','c'],['b','c','c']]
d = gensim.corpora.Dictionary(texts)
bow = [d.doc2bow(doc) for doc in texts]

my_topics=[[2/3, 1/3, 0],[0, 2/3, 1/3]]
model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=bow, id2word=d, num_topics=2, 
        eta=..., alpha..., passes=0, iterations=0, random_state=1)
model.show_topics(num_words=3)
# Hopefully return my_topics above
#[(0, '0.666*""a"" + 0.333*""b""'),
# (1, '0.666*""b"" + 0.333*""c""')]
</code></pre>

<p>I was hoping to achieve this by initializing eta in the LDA model and by setting iterations to 0. In my attempts (not shown) the resulting topics are not the same as 'my_topics'. </p>

<p><a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html#gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gensim docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>eta ({float, np.array, str}, optional) –</p>
  
  <p>A-priori belief on word probability, this can be:</p>

<pre><code>    scalar for a symmetric prior over topic/word probability,
    vector of length num_words to denote an asymmetric user defined probability for each word,
    matrix of shape (num_topics, num_words) to assign a probability for each word-topic combination,
    the string ‘auto’ to learn the asymmetric prior from the data.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT: This (calling reset on the model's state) seems to work, but I am not sure it makes theoretically sense</p>

<pre><code>model = gensim.models.LdaModel(corpus=bow, id2word=d, num_topics=2, 
    eta=my_topics, alpha=1, passes=0, iterations=0, random_state=1)
model.state.reset()
model.show_topics(num_words=3)
#array([[0.6666667 , 0.33333334, 0.        ],
#   [0.        , 0.6666667 , 0.33333334]], dtype=float32)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the topic distribution for a given document is not trained and I do not think it can be keeping the topics constant:</p>

<pre><code>model.get_document_topics(bow[2])
model[bow[2]]
#[(0, 0.55569696), (1, 0.44430298)]

<p>My problem is that there is a lot of overlap between the topics (whether I pick 5, 10, or 50 topics). Every topic has a distribution of words like ""model"" ""algorithm"", or ""problem."" How can topics be considered differentiable if so many of them prominently feature the same terms? </p>

<p>Using pyLDAvis was instructive for me . This is the distribution for topic #3:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLWCn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tLWCn.png"" alt=""topics with lambda equal one""></a></p>

<p>But when I turn down <code>lambda = 0.08</code>, the actual nature of the topic emerges (ML in medical applications):
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHyWn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHyWn.png"" alt=""topics with low lambda""></a></p>

<p>So my question is, how could I uncover these distinctive terms in the course of training my LDA model (without pyLDAvis)? And also, does the performance (as opposed to interpret-ability) of the model improve if I can get it to ignore these common, non-discriminating terms?</p>

<p>I have several ideas to try but would like more guidance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filtering the 50 most common terms from my dictionary. While I think it helped a bit, I'm not sure if it's the right approach</li>
<li>Tweaking <code>eta</code> parameter in <code>gensim.models.LdaModel</code></li>
</ul>

<p>My goal is ultimately to take a new document and do word coloring on it based on which words relate to which topics, and also offer the documents most similar to the input document.</p>

<p>I am pretty new with <code>gensim</code>, and this is my first SO question, so if I'm totally off-base with something, please let me know ;-). Thank you</p>

In order to do that, i have chosen a data set that contains approximately 70000 article, and every article contains between 1500 and 2000 words.<br />
These articles are divided into 5 classes.<br />
while setting up my input, i chosen as tag for my document their corresponding label.
I have done it as follow :
<code>tagged_article = data.apply(lambda r: TaggedDocument(words=r['article'].split(), tags=[r.labels]), axis=1)</code><br />
then i have trained my model with the following line codes:</p>
<pre><code>model_dbow = Doc2Vec(dm=1, vector_size=300, negative=5, min_count=10, workers=cores)
model_dbow.build_vocab([x for x in tqdm(tagged_article.values)])

     model_dbow.alpha -= 0.002
     model_dbow.min_alpha = model_dbow.alpha

<p>I have managed to identify the k topics and their most-used words, and I understand that LDA is about probabilistic distributions of topics and how words are distributed within those topics in the documents, so that much makes sense. </p>

<p>That said, I do not understand how to use the LdaModel to retrieve the documents that are relevant to a string input of search query eg ""negative effects of birth control"". I have tried inferring topic distributions on the search query and finding similarities between the topic distribution on the search query and the topic distributions from the corpus using gensim's similarities.MatrixSimilarity to compute cosine similarity like so:</p>

<p><code>lda = LdaModel(corpus, num_topics=10)
 index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(lda[corpus])
 query = lda[query_bow]
 sims = index[query]</code></p>

<p>But the performance isn't really good. What I figure is that finding the topic distribution of the search query is not too meaningful because there is usually only 1 topic in the search query. But I don't know how else I could implement this on the LdaModel on gensim. Any advice would be really appreciated, I am new to topic modeling and maybe I am missing something that's glaringly obvious to me? Thanks!</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~reidy.16/LSAtutorial.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one LSA paper</a>, I read that each cell of the document-term matrix is the log-frequency of that word in that document, divided by the entropy of that word:</p>

idf(w, D) = 1 / (-Σ_D p(w) log p(w))

I've been using gensim's word2vec model to create some vectors. I exported them into text, and tried importing it on tensorflow's live model of the embedding projector. One problem. <em>It didn't work</em>. It told me that the tensors were improperly formatted. So, being a beginner, I thought I would ask some people with more experience about possible solutions.<br>
Equivalent to my code:  </p>

<pre><code>import gensim
corpus = [[""words"",""in"",""sentence"",""one""],[""words"",""in"",""sentence"",""two""]]
model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(iter = 5,size = 64)
model.build_vocab(corpus)
# save memory
vectors = model.wv
del model
vectors.save_word2vec_format(""vect.txt"",binary = False)

<p>That creates the model, saves the vectors, and then prints the results out nice and pretty in a tab delimited file with values for all of the dimensions. I understand how to do what I'm doing, I just can't figure out what's wrong with the way I put it in tensorflow, as the documentation regarding that is pretty scarce as far as I can tell.<br>
One idea that has been presented to me is implementing the appropriate tensorflow code, but I don’t know how to code that, just import files in the live demo.  </p>

<p>Edit: I have a new problem now. The object I have my vectors in is non-iterable because gensim apparently decided to make its own data structures that are non-compatible with what I'm trying to do.<br>

To experiment with the performance, I tried implementing it by training the LDA Model with TfIdf vectors instead of the normal BoW corpus as described in the documentation. The problem which I am facing is that while using the Similarity API of Gensim for creating the index and finding out the similarity score, what I encountered is that if I try to match the same document with itself, sometimes, the Similarity values are not ~1. The values which I get are as low as ~0.06. This does not occur ALL the time, but for some documents only. I tested this again with 229 documents matching each document with itself, and I found that 45 of the documents give results less than 0.98, sometimes giving values like 0.65, 0.41 and similar. I would like some help on this, whether I am doing something wrong or is it any other problem.</p>

<p>I have vectors with some sample data and each vector has a category name (Places,Colors,Names).</p>

<pre><code>['john','jay','dan','nathan','bob']  -&gt; 'Names'
['yellow', 'red','green'] -&gt; 'Colors'
['tokyo','bejing','washington','mumbai'] -&gt; 'Places'
</code></pre>

<p>My objective is to train a model that take a new input string and predict which category it belongs to. For example if a new input is ""purple"" then I should be able to predict 'Colors' as the correct category. If the new input is ""Calgary"" it should predict 'Places' as the correct category.</p>

<p><strong>APPROACH</strong></p>

<p>I did some research and came across <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Word2vec</a>. This library has a ""similarity"" and ""mostsimilarity"" function which i can use. So one brute force approach I thought of is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take new input.</li>
<li>Calculate it's similarity with each word in each vector and take an average.</li>
</ol>

<p>So for instance for input ""pink"" I can calculate its similarity with words in vector ""names"" take a average and then do that for the other 2 vectors also. The vector that gives me the highest similarity average would be the correct vector for the input to belong to.</p>

<p><strong>ISSUE</strong></p>

<p>Given my limited knowledge in NLP and machine learning I am not sure if that is the best approach and hence I am looking for help and suggestions on better approaches to solve my problem. I am open to all suggestions and also please point out any mistakes I may have made as I am new to machine learning and NLP world.</p>

<p>I would like to output the 1000 most frequently used words with frequency from a Gensim Word2Vec model. However, I am not interested in certain words, which I therefore filter using numpy (np.stdiff1d).After that I create a new list using '/n'.join, but now I have the problem that every time I call an entry from the list '/n'.join is entered in front of the word (e.g. instead of house /nhouse), so I get a key error.</p>
<p>I tried to work around it by saving the list (corpus_words) as .txt and “open with“, but even then, there is a /n in front of each entry, when I try to get the frequency of the word.</p>
<p>to use a print statement beforer &quot;/n&quot;.join(new_list) did not help either.</p>
<p>is there any way to fix this?</p>

I would like to concatenate the two of them and calculate the similarity of a given input word, choosing the returned vectors from the concatenated model. I read a lot of comments regarding the fact that this method may not be particularly suited for performance improvement and that it might be necessary to change the source code to the KeyedVector class in gensim to enable it. Up to now I attempted to do that using the Translation Matrix but it returns 5 features from the second model and I am not sure about whether it is performing the translations correctly or not.
Has anybody already encountered this issue? Is there another way to calculate the similarity for an input word in a concatenated doc2vec model?
Up to now I have been able to reproduce this:</p>
<pre><code>vocab1 = model1.wv
vocab2 = model2.wv

concatenated_vectors = {}
vocab_concatenated = vocab1
for i in range(len(vocab1.vectors)):
    v1 = vocab1.vectors[i] 
    v2 = vocab2.vectors[i]
    vocab_concatenated[list(vocab1.vocab.keys())[i]] = np.concatenate((v1, v2))

<pre><code>.add_vectors(list(vocab1.vocab.keys()), vocab_concatenated[list(vocab1.vocab.keys())])

<p>classes - Travel,Hotel,Cars,Electronics,Food,Movies</p>

<p>I am approaching this problem with the famous <code>Text Classification</code> problem. Feature set is prepared by using <code>Doc2Vec</code> default model from <code>gensim</code> and for classification I am using <code>Logistic Regression</code> oneVSrest from <code>sklearn</code>. </p>

<p>For every class I feed 10000 reviews to <code>Doc2Vec</code>.( I am following this <a href=""https://rare-technologies.com/doc2vec-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doc2Vec</a> tutorial). In this way the model learns vector for each sentence. From the resulting vectors, 80% from each class are given to <code>LogisticRegression</code> for training and 20% for testing. The accuracy of classifier is 98%. But for unseen data the accuracy is just 17%. Also <code>PCA</code> of all sentence vectors when plotted in a 2D graph resulted in one dense cluster. What I can conclude from the graph is that the data is inseparable but then how the classifier gave an accuracy of 98%? Also, why on unseen data the accuracy is very low? How can I evaluate/validate my results. </p>

<pre><code># import warnings
# warnings.filterwarnings(action = 'ignore', category = UserWarning, module = 'gensim')
import sys
from gensim.corpora import WikiCorpus

def make_corpus (in_f, out_f):
    print(0)
    output = open(out_f, 'w', encoding = 'utf-8')
    print(1)
    wiki = WikiCorpus(in_f)
    print(2)
    i = 0
    for text in wiki.get_texts():
        output.write(bytes(' '.join(text), 'utf-8').decode('utf-8') + '/n')
        i += 1
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print('Processed {} articles!'.format(i))
    print(3)
    output.close()
    print('Process complete!')



print('start')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print('Usage: python make_wiki_corpus.py &lt;wikipedia_dump_file&gt; &lt;processed_text_file&gt;')
        sys.exit(1)
    in_f = sys.argv[1]
    out_f = sys.argv[2]
    make_corpus(in_f, out_f)
else:
    print(__name__)
</code></pre>

<p>However, the function branch seems to run partly, stopping at the <code>wiki = WikiCorpus(in_f)</code> - it never makes it to <code>print(2)</code> - and then exiting and repeating the beginning of the code, yielding no results. No error actually comes up, only a warning (<code>UserWarning: detected Windows; aliasing chunkize to chunkize_serial warnings.warn(""detected Windows; aliasing chunkize to chunkize_serial"")</code>).</p>

<p>The output is this:</p>

<pre><code>start

<p>I've tried uninstalling all required packages (numpy, smart_open), as well as gensim itself (in an active conda environment), but nothing has changed.
Also, what is the difference between the <strong>main</strong> and the multiprocessing one?</p>

However, I like to train doc2vec on a relatively small corpus ~100 docs so that it can classify my domain specific documents. </p>

<p><strong>To elaborate let me use this toy example.</strong> Assume I've only 4 training docs given  by 4 sentences - ""I love hot chocolate."", ""I hate hot chocolate."", ""I love hot tea."", and ""I love hot cake."".
Given a test document ""I adore hot chocolate"", I would expect, doc2vec will invariably return ""I love hot chocolate."" as the closest document. This expectation will be true if word2vec already supplies the knowledge that ""adore"" is very similar to ""love"". However, I'm getting most similar document as ""I hate hot chocolate"" -- which is a bizarre!!</p>

<p>Any suggestion on how to circumvent this, i.e. be able to use pre-trained word embeddings so that I don't need to venture into training ""adore"" is close to ""love"", ""hate"" is close to ""detest"", and so on.</p>

<p>I've downloaded models from Google Drive folder, and though that it can somehow damage .npy files (as they are quite big), so I've downloaded each file (there 7 files for that model) separately, but this didn`t help me.</p>

<p>Also, I read that sometimes it can be caused because of bad unzipping in the 'load' method, but I'm passing already unzipped files into it, so this also don`t work for me.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBzId.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBzId.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here i have already cleaned and tokenize the data in column <strong>q1_clean</strong> &amp; <strong>q1_clean</strong>.</p>

<p>Now i have trained the <strong>W2vModel</strong> by using GoogleNews pretrained model with the following code. </p>

<pre><code># We are concating the two columns of Question1 and Question2

nData = pd.Series(pd.concat([data['q1_clean'], data['q2_clean']]))
model_w2v = Word2Vec(nData, size=300) 

# step 2: intersect the initialized word2vec model with the pre-trained fasttext model
model_w2v.intersect_word2vec_format('GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin',lockf=1.0,binary=True)

# step 3: improve model with transfer-learning using the training data
model_w2v.train(nData, total_examples=model_w2v.corpus_count, epochs= 10)

</code></pre>

<p>Now i have to do the feature analysis, for that i have following function to get the average computed distance.</p>

<pre><code>def get_pairwise_distance(word1, word2, weight1, weight2, method = 'euclidean'):
    if(word1.size==0 or word2.size==0):
        return np.nan
    dist_matrix = pairwise_distances(word1, word2, metric=method)
    return np.average(dist_matrix, weights=np.matmul(weight1.reshape(-1,1),weight2.reshape(-1,1).T))
</code></pre>

<p>Here i have computed the tfidf to use as a weights: </p>

<pre><code>X_train_tokens = get_tokenized_questions(data=X_train)

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
pass_through = lambda x:x
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=pass_through)
# compute tf-idf weights for the words in the training set questions
X_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train_tokens)

# split into two
# X1_tfidf -&gt; tf-idf weights of first question in question pair and 
# X2_tfidf -&gt; tf-idf weights of second question in question pair
X1_tfidf = X_tfidf[:len(X_train)]
X2_tfidf = X_tfidf[len(X_train):]
</code></pre>

<p>and i am calling this <strong>get_pairwise_distance</strong> function like in the <a href=""https://medium.springboard.com/identifying-duplicate-questions-a-machine-learning-case-study-37117723844"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tutorial</a>.</p>

<pre><code>#cosine similarities

# and X1_tfidf and X2_tfidf are the tf-idf weights of the first and second questions in the question-pair data

cosine = compute_pairwise_dist(X1, X2, X1_tfidf, X2_tfidf)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>For this function i need to pass the embedded version of <em>q1_clean</em> and <em>q2_clean</em> as X1 and X2 where weights are already computed using TFIDF. and i am getting no clue how to embed these two columns into vectors using pretrained model and pass it to the given function?</strong> </p>

Firstly, I have 3 different datasets, one with 15k documents another with 50k documents and last with 2m documents. I am trying to test models with different number of topics (<strong>k</strong>) ranging from 5 to 100 with a step size of 5. This is in order to check which <strong>k</strong> results in the best model assessed with initially with the highest coherence score. For each <strong>k</strong>, I also build 3 different models with chunksize 10, 100 and 1000.</p>
<p>So now moving onto the problem I am having. Obviously my own machine is too slow and does not have enough cores for this kind of computation hence I am using my university's server. The problem here is my program seems to be consuming too much memory and I am unsure of the reason. I already made some adjustments such that the corpus is not loaded entirely to memory (or atleast I think I did). The dataset with 50k entries already at iteration <strong>k=50</strong> (so halfway) seems to have consumed the alloted 100GB of memory, which seems very huge.</p>

<pre><code>gensim.utils.prune_vocab(vocab, min_reduce, trim_rule=None):
    Remove all entries from the vocab dictionary with count smaller than min_reduce.

<p>But in practice, setting the minimum count is empirical and does not seems quite exact. I notice that the term frequency of each word in the vocabulary often follows long-tail distribution, is it a good way if I only keep the top-K words that occupies X% (95%, 90%, 85%, ...) of the total term frequency? Or are there any sensible ways to reduce the vocabulary, without seriously influencing the NLP task? </p>

<p>After this training - any of two similarity calculation produce zero:</p>

<pre><code>speed - velocity - 0
high - low - 0
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems that the iterator is not working well so I've checked it using gojomo trick:</p>

<pre><code>print(sum(1 for _ in s))
1

print(sum(1 for _ in s))
1

<p>And its working. </p>

<p>What may be the problem?</p>

<p>In this Notebook the Document similarity for a small set of documents gets computed however I want to compute the similarity for the whole corpus.</p>

<p>So here's how I am currently getting the final TF-IDF score for each word,</p>

<pre><code>tfidf = gensim.models.tfidfmodel.TfidfModel(corpus)
corpus_tfidf = tfidf[corpus]
d = {}
for doc in corpus_tfidf:
    for id, value in doc:
        word = dictionary.get(id)
        d[word] = value
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<p>I decided to try out Gensim, a tool to find out topics for a choosen word &amp; context. </p>

<p>So I wondered how to find a word in a section of text and extract 20 words together with it (as in 10 words before that spectic word and 10 words after that specific word) then to save it together with other such extractions so Gensim could be run on it.</p>

<p>What seems to be hard for me is to find a way to extract the 10 before and after words when the choosen word is found. I played with nltk before and by just tokenizing the text into words or sentences it was easy to get hold of the sentences. Still getting those words or the sentences before and after that specific sentence seems hard for me to figure out how to do.</p>

<p>For those who are confused (it's 1am here so I may be confusing) I'll show it with an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as it had finished, all her blood rushed to her heart, for she
  was so angry to hear that Snow-White was yet living. ""But now,""
  thought she to herself, ""will I make something which shall destroy her
  completely."" Thus saying, she made a poisoned comb by arts which she
  understood, and then, disguising herself, she took the form of an old
  widow. She went over the seven hills to the house of the seven Dwarfs,
  and[15] knocking at the door, called out, ""Good wares to sell to-day!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we say the word is Snow-White then I'd want to get this part extracted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>her heart, for she was so angry to hear that Snow-White was yet living. ""But now,""
  thought she to herself, ""will</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10 word before and after Snow-White. </p>

<p>It is also cool enough to instead get the sentence before and after the sentence Snow-White appeared in if this can be done in nltk and is easier. </p>

<p>I mean whatever works best I shall be happy with one of the two solutions if someone could help me.</p>

<p>If this can be done with Gensim too...and that is easier, then I shall be happy with that too. So any of the 3 ways will be fine...I just want to try and see how this can be done because atm my head is blank.</p>

<p>which should mean when looking at context it doesn't go beyond the sentence boundary. right?</p>

<p>What i did was i created a document with several thousand tweets and selected a word (<code>q1</code>) and then selected most similar words to <code>q1</code> (using <code>model.most_similar('q1')</code>). But then, if I randomly shuffle the tweets in the input document and then did the same experiment (without changing word2vec parameters) I got a different set most_similar words to <code>q1</code>.</p>

<p>Can't really understand why that happens if only it's gonna look at is sentence level information? can anyone explain this?</p>

<p><b> EDIT: added model parameters and a graph </b> </p>

<p>used model parameters:</p>

<pre><code>model1 = word2vec.Word2Vec(sents1 , size=100, window=5, min_count=5, iter=n_iter, sg=0)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Graph</strong>: 
To draw the graph what i did was I ran word2vec with above parameters for the original document (D) and the shuffled document (D') and took the top 10 or 20 (two bars) <code>most_similar('q')</code> words to a specific query word <code>q</code>, and calculated the jaccard similarity score between the two sets of words when iter=1,10,100. </p>

<p>It seems as the no of iterations increase, lesser and lesser similar words between the two sets of words got from running word2vec on D and D'.</p>

<ol>
<li>Just concat the metadata to the word. (so that the word ""desk"" will be coded as ""desk-furniture-Noun""</li>

1. What will be a better way?
2. How can I create a new loss function and optimize it in Word2Vec? Can I just pass a parameter to Gensim's Word2Vec or do I need to build a new Word2vec model from scratch?</p>

This standalone does not provide good results due to lesser size of the corpus. This especially hurts as we want to evaluate on words that may very well be outside the vocabulary of the text book.</p>

<p>We want the textbook to encode the domain specific relationships and semantic ""nearness"". ""Quantum"" and ""Heisenberg"" are especially close in this textbook for eg. which may not hold true for background corpus. To handle the generic words (like ""any"") we need the basic background model(like the one provided by Google on word2vec site).  </p>

<p>Is there any way that we can supplant to the background model using our newer corpus. Just training on the corpus etc. doesnot work well.</p>

First, I should tokenize each sentences to its words, hence converting each sentence to a list of words. Then, this list should be appended to a final list. Therefore, at the end, I will have a  nested list containing all tokenized sentences:</p>
<pre><code>word_punctuation_tokenizer = nltk.WordPunctTokenizer()
word_tokenized_corpus = []
for line in open('sentences.txt'):
   new = line.strip()
   new = word_punctuation_tokenizer.tokenize(new)
   if len(new) != 0:
       word_tokenized_corpus.append(new)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the model should be built as the following:</p>
<pre><code>embedding_size = 60
window_size = 40
min_word = 5
down_sampling = 1e-2
ft_model = FastText(word_tokenized_corpus,

</code></pre>
<p>However, the number of sentences in &quot;word_tokenized_corpus&quot; is very large and the program can't handle it. Is it possible that I train the model by giving each tokenized sentence to it one by one, such as the following:?</p>
<pre><code> for line in open('sentences.txt'):
  new = line.strip()
  new = word_punctuation_tokenizer.tokenize(new)

To reduce computing workload I would like to run word2vec only on the data that was accumulated during the last month. My problem stems from the fact that for further processing I require the embeddings from the models I ran in previous months.</p>

<p>I know, also from reading other posts, that if the individual word2vec models are run on different samples which each are not a representative sample of an overarching corpus, obtaining word embeddings that are comparable is not possible. I have a similar problem, where I am analysing network data, which evolves over time (effectively doing a kind of graph2vec, but analysing node behaviour).</p>

<p>Yet I've been wondering if comparable embeddings can be achieved using PCA as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>all models create ""node"" embeddings of length x</li>
<li>for each model: 

<ul>
<li>run PCA on the ""node"" embeddings and retain all x principal        components, whereby whitening is enabled</li>
<li>transform the individual ""node"" embeddings to their corresponding PCA coordinates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>since the individual samples used to train the individual models share a high proportion of nodes as existing ones tend to stay and
new ones are likely to be added do the following:

<ul>
<li>append all pca-transformed embeddings into one database</li>
<li>by nodeID calculate mean pca_transformed embedding</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This would only work, if the PCA transformation of the embeddings of each model ensures that the resulting embeddings measure the ""same thing"". For example, the first principal component of each PCA should capture the same kind of information, etc. And that's what I'm not sure about.</p>

However, I get an error that says it's an <code>unexpected keyword</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p>The Word2Vec class on GitHub <a href=""https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/word2vec.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">does have</a> the 'compute_loss' keyword, but my local library does not.
I see that the gensim documentation and library deviate from each other.
I found that the <code>win-64/gensim-2.2.0-np113py35_0.tar.bz2</code>-file in <a href=""https://anaconda.org/anaconda/gensim/files"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conda repository</a> is not up to date.</p>

<p>However after uninstalling gensim with conda, <code>pip install gensim</code> did not change anything as it still doesn't work.</p>

<p>Apparently, the source on GitHub and the distributed library are different, but the tutorial seems to assume code is as on GitHub.</p>

<p>I want to get a full topic distribution for all <code>num_topics</code> for each and every document. That is, in this particular case, I want each document to have 50 topics contributing to the distribution <strong><em>and</em></strong> I want to be able to access all 50 topics' contribution. This output is what LDA should do if adhering strictly to the mathematics of LDA. However, gensim only outputs topics that exceed a certain threshold as shown <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23509699/understanding-lda-transformed-corpus-in-gensim/37708396?noredirect=1#comment77429460_37708396"">here</a></strong>.

<p>which shows only 3 topics that contribute most to document 89. I have tried the solution in the link above, however this does not work for me. I still get the same output:</p>

<pre><code>theta, _ = lda.inference(corpus)
theta /= theta.sum(axis=1)[:, None]
</code></pre>

<p>produces the same output i.e. only 2,3 topics per document.</p>

<p>My question is how do I change this threshold so I can access the <strong><em>FULL</em></strong> topic distribution for <strong><em>each</em></strong> document? How can I access the full topic distribution, no matter how insignificant the contribution of a topic to a document? The reason I want the full distribution is so I can perform a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence"" rel=""noreferrer"">KL similarity</a> search between documents' distribution.</p>

<p>I searched a lot and some people suggest that the Word2vec text files should have a first line containing the number of words and dimensions. I tried to add those to the file but it didn't work either:</p>

    raise ValueError(&quot;invalid vector on line %s (is this really the text format?)&quot; % line_no)

ValueError: invalid vector on line 0 (is this really the text format?)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, for the last line of error (ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '-1.552761644124984741e-01'), I believe there should be some issues with the file containing decimal values and not integers. I don't know how to change the default data type to float.</p>
<p>I haven't had a chance to investigate the issues with R much, but I get &quot;object X not found&quot; error when I run this code:</p>
<pre><code>df &lt;- read.wordvectors('syn0_ngram_1900_1909_full', type = 'txt', normalize = FALSE)
</code></pre>
<p>I've checked and I'm sure there's no issue with the directory or spelling.</p>

My issue is that the reviews mention the word &quot;service&quot; quite often and so Phraser finds lots of different bigrams with &quot;service&quot; as one of the pairs (e.g &quot;helpful_service&quot;, &quot;good_service&quot;, &quot;service_price&quot;).</p>
<p>These are then present across multiple topics in the final result*. I'm thinking that I could prevent this from occurring if I was able to tell Phraser <em>not</em> to include &quot;service&quot; when making bigrams. Is this possible?</p>
<p>(*) I am aware that &quot;service&quot;-related bigrams being present across multiple topics might indeed be the optimal result, but I just want to experiment with leaving them out.</p>
<p>Sample code:</p>
<pre><code># import gensim models
from gensim.models import Phrases
from gensim.models.phrases import Phraser

# sample data
data = [
    &quot;Very quick service left a big tip&quot;,
    &quot;Very bad service left a complaint to the manager&quot;
]
data_words = [doc.split(&quot; &quot;) for doc in data]

# build the bigram model
bigram_phrases = Phrases(data_words, min_count=2, threshold=0, scoring='npmi') 
# note I used the arguments above to force &quot;service&quot; based bigrams to be created for this example
bigram_phraser = Phraser(bigram_phrases)

# print the result
for word in data_words:
    tokens_ = bigram_phraser[word]
    print(tokens_)
</code></pre>
<p>The above prints:</p>
<pre><code>['Very', 'quick', 'service_left', 'a', 'big', 'tip']
['Very', 'bad', 'service_left', 'complaint', 'to', 'the', 'manager']

<pre><code>def get_doc(data):

tokenizer = RegexpTokenizer(r'\w+')

p_stemmer = PorterStemmer()

taggeddoc = []

    # remove stop words from tokens

<p>to this</p>

<p>I thought about a search strategy where the python code automatically removes all content after the last mention of ""references"" or ""bibliography"".

<p>I am implementing <code>gensim</code> for document similarity. After retrieving the <code>gensim</code> Similarity object index and similarity score for a new document, I would like to trace that index back to the original document in the corpus. Based on the answer in the question above, it looks like there is no built-in way to achieve this. </p>

<p>The df that feeds into my corpus looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>id    text
1-23  She loathes apples
1-52  I like rocks
1-43  You like ice cream
1-67  He hates bananas
</code></pre>

<p>After building the <code>gensim</code> model (tweaking it for dataframes from this tutorial: <a href=""https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-do-i-compare-document-similarity-using-python"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.oreilly.com/learning/how-do-i-compare-document-similarity-using-python</a>), I run the following new document through:</p>

<pre><code>id    text
1-98  I like neutrons
</code></pre>

<p>I can get the max similarity score and the index of the Similarity object with this function:</p>

<pre><code>def search(row):
    query = [w.lower() for w in word_tokenize(row)]
    queryBOW = dictionary.doc2bow(query)
    queryTFIDF = tfidf[queryBOW]
    maxSim = max(sims[queryTFIDF])
    index = [i for i, j in enumerate(sims[queryTFIDF]) if j == maxSim]
    return maxSim, index
</code></pre>

<p>After unpacking the tuple into separate df columns:</p>

<pre><code>id    text              maxSim    index
1-98  I like neutrons   0.5678    4
</code></pre>

<p>The index of the Similarity object does not match the index of the original dataframe.</p>

<p>How would I carry the original dataframe index into the similarity object? Or, how would I carry the <code>id</code> field from the original dataframe object into the Similarity object? I understand I have to keep a separate mapping between Similarity object index and original dataframe index - what does that mapping look like?</p>

<p>Desired result:</p>

<pre><code>id    text              maxSim    index   originalTextID    originalText

I will try to explain a little bit my situation</p>

<p>I want to use gensim LDA implemented methods in order to proceed further to text classification. I have one dataset which is consisted from three parts(train(25K), test(25K) and unlabeled data(50K)). What I am trying to do is to learn the latent topics space using the unlabeled data and then transform the train and test set into this learned latent topic space. I am currently using the Scikit Learn implemented methods in order to extract the BoW representation. Later, I am transforming to the required inputs for the LDA implementation and at the end I am transforming the train and test set into the extracted latent topic space. Finally, I am going back to csr matrices in order to fit a classifier and to obtain the accuracy. <strong>Although, it seems to me that everything is fine, the performance of the classifier is almost 0%. I am attaching part of the code in order to get some additional help or if there is something obvious that I am currently missing.</strong></p>

<p>i am using this tutorial as reference: <a href=""https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://rare-technologies.com/word2vec-tutorial/</a></p>

<p>it is suggested that by default gensim.models.word2vec will iterate over the corpus at least twice. once for initialization and then again for training (iterating the number of epochs specified) </p>

<p>since i am always using the same corpus, i want to save time by initializing only once, and providing the same initialization as input to all successive models.</p>

<p>how can this be done?</p>

<p><strong>For example :</strong></p>

<p>""I keep getting an error message every time I log in"" has to be tagged with ""login"" as the topic.</p>

<p>""make the screen more colorful"" has to be tagged with ""improvements"" as the topic.</p>

<p>So the <strong>topics are very specific to the product and the context</strong>.</p>

<p>LDA doesn't seem to work for me(correct me if i'm wrong). It detects the topics in a general sense like ""Sports"" , ""Politics"" , ""Technology"" etc. But I need to detect specific topics as mentioned above.</p>

<p>Also , I don't have labelled data for training. All I have is the comments.
So supervised learning approach doesn't look like an option.</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried so far:</strong></p>

<p>I trained a gensim model with google news corpus (its about 3.5 gb).
I am cleaning the sentence by removing stop words , punctuation marks etc.
I am finding , to what topic among the set of topics each word is closest to and tag the word to that topic. With an idea that the sentence might contain more words closer to the topic it is referring to than not , I am picking up the topic(s) to which maximum number of words in the sentence is mapped to.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

<p>If 3 words in a sentence is mapped to ""login"" topic and 2 words in the sentence is mapped to ""improvement"" topic , I am tagging the sentence to ""login"" topic. </p>

<p>If there is a clash between the count of multiple topics , I return all the topics with the maximum count as the topic list.</p>

<p>This approach is giving me fair results. But its not good enough.</p>

<p>The yield operation occurs at the end of reading each file</p>

<p>I have another method named <code>uploadCorpus</code> (<strong>find code below</strong>). The main aim of this method is to upload that corpus. </p>

<p>This is how I used to trin my doc2vec:</p>

<pre><code>training_iterations = 20
d2v = Doc2Vec(vector_size=200, workers=cpu_count(), alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.00025, dm=0)
d2v.build_vocab(corpus)

for epoch in range(training_iterations):
    d2v.train(corpus, total_examples=d2v.corpus_count, epochs=d2v.iter)
    d2v.alpha -= 0.0002
    d2v.min_alpha = d2v.alpha
</code></pre>

<p>And it is classifying documents quite well, only draw back is that when it is trained CPUs are utilized at 70%</p>

<p>So the new way:</p>

<pre><code>corpus_fname = ""spped.data""
save_as_line_sentence(corpus, corpus_fname)

# Choose num of cores that you want to use (let's use all, models scale linearly now!)
num_cores = cpu_count()

# Train models using all cores
d2v_model = Doc2Vec(corpus_file=corpus_fname, workers=num_cores, dm=0, vector_size=200, epochs=50)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Now all CPUs are utilized at 100%</strong></p>

<p>but the model is performing very poorly.
According to the documentation, I should not use the train method also, I should use only epoch count and not iterations, also the min_aplpha and aplha values should not be touched.</p>

<p>The configuration of both Doc2Vec looks the same to me so is there an issue with my new set up or configuration, or there is something wrong with the new version of gensim?</p>

<p>P.S I am using the same corpus in both cases, also I tried epoch count = 100, also with smaller numbers like 5-20, but I had no luck</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: First model was doing 20 iterations 5 epoch each, second was doing 50 epoch, so having the second model make 100 epochs made it perform even better, since I was no longer managing the alpha by myself.</p>

<p>About the second issue that popped up: when providing file with line documents, the doc ids were not always corresponding to the lines, I didn't manage to figure out what could be causing this, it seems to work fine for small corpus, If I find out what I am doing wrong I will update this answer.</p>

<p>The final configuration for corpus of size 4GB looks like this</p>

<pre><code>    d2v = Doc2Vec(vector_size=200, workers=cpu_count(), alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.00025, dm=0)
    d2v.build_vocab(corpus)

Firstly I tried bag-of-words and then several clustering algorithms which gave me a good result, but now I am trying to step into doc2vec representation and it seems to not be working for me, I cannot load prepared model and work with it, instead training my own doesnt prove any result.</p>

<pre><code>sims = model.docvecs.most_similar([inferred_vector], topn=len(model.docvecs))
</code></pre>

<p>is working much worse than the same for Bag-of-words with my model.
By much worse i mean that identical or almost identical text have similarity score compatible to text which dont have any connection i can think about. So i decided to use model from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51132848/is-there-pre-trained-doc2vec-model"">Is there pre-trained doc2vec model?</a> to use some pretrained model which might have more connections between words. Sorry for somewhat long preambula but the question is how do i plug it in? Can someone provide some ideas how do i, using the loaded gensim model from <a href=""https://github.com/jhlau/doc2vec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/jhlau/doc2vec</a> convert my own dataset of text into vectors of same length? My data is preprocesssed (stemmed, no punctuation, lowercase, no nlst.corpus stopwords)and i can deliver it from list or dataframe or file if needed, the code question is how to pass my own data to pretrained model? Any help would be appreciated.</p>

Each document, after preprocessing and removing unnecessary words and stopwords, has about 7000 sentences (as determined by nlkt's sentence tokenizer) and each sentence has about 17 words on average. My job is to find hidden themes in those documents. </p>

<p>I have thought about doing topic modeling. However, I cannot decide if the data I have is enough to obtain meaningful results via LDA or is there anything else that I can do. </p>

<p>Also, how do I divide the texts into different documents? Is 140 documents (each with roughly 7000 x 17 words) enough ? or should I consider each sentence as a document. But then each document will have only 17 words on average; much like tweets. </p>

<p>Any suggestions would be helpful.

Facebook <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MUSE</a> provides aligned, supervised <a href=""https://github.com/facebookresearch/MUSE#multilingual-word-embeddings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">word embeddings for 30 languages</a>, and it can be used to calculate word similarity across different languages. As far as I understand, The embeddings provided by MUSE satisfy the requirement of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45571295/semantic-similarity-across-multiple-languages"">coordinate space compatibilty</a>. It seems that it is possible to <a href=""https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/20071/how-do-i-load-fasttext-pretrained-model-with-gensim"">load these embeddings into libraries such as Gensim</a>, but I wonder: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it possible to load multiple-language word embeddings 
into Gensim (or other libraries), and if so:</li>
<li>What type of similarity measure
might fit in this use case?</li>
<li>How to use these loaded word embeddings
to calculate cross-lingual similarity score of phrases* instead of
words?</li>
</ol>

<p>*e.g., ""<em>ÖPNV</em>"" in German vs ""<em>Trasporto pubblico locale</em>"" in Italian for the English term ""<em>Public Transport</em>"". </p>

<p>I am open o any implementation (libraries/languages/embeddings) though I may need some time to learn this topic. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Which was fixed by changing <code>from itertools import chain</code> to <code>from itertools import chain, ifilter</code>. The module then works perfectly. </p>

<p>So, I guess my question is whether this was an error specific to my system (is there some kind of 'import all' python trick that doesn't work for me?).</p>

<p>I already have running code for the same on my Local system.</p>

<p><strong>Here is some sample code that already works on my local System:</strong></p>

<pre><code>import os

os.environ['MALLET_HOME'] = 'C:/Users/Soumadiptya.c/Desktop/mallet-2.0.8'

mallet_path = 'C:/Users/Soumadiptya.c/Desktop/mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet'

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here is what I am trying to execute on my Databricks instance:</strong></p>

<pre><code>os.environ['MALLET_HOME'] = '/dbfs/FileStore/tables/mallet-2.0.8'

mallet_path_new = '/dbfs/FileStore/tables/mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet'

new_model = gensim.models.wrappers.ldamallet.LdaMallet(mallet_path_new, corpus=corpus, num_topics=20, id2word=id2word)

<p>But this exits with the following error:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Please note that I have already imported the necessary mallet files to the mentioned directories and the paths themselves exist. I'm assuming the problem is something with setting up Env variables inside databricks but unable to figure out. Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<li>As a bonus, how is <code>d</code> calculated? The paper only says:</li>

  <p>In our Paragraph Vector framework (see Figure 2), every

<p>From here I am generating a 1D array for each <code>disease/disease combination</code> by taking the average of the vectors. The issue with averaging word vectors is the fact that the combination of 2 or more diseases can have the same average vector as a totally different disease which is not at all relevant but the average vectors get matched. This makes the concept of averaging vectors flawed. To counter this, the understanding is with an increase in dimension of the vectors, this should be even less of a possibility.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there a better way than averaging the output from word2vec vectors to generate a 1D array?</p>
</li>
<li><p>These generated vectors will be treated as features to a classifier model that I am trying to build for each disease/disease combination so, if I generate a 100D feature vector from word2vec, shall I use something like a PCA on it to reduce the dimension or shall I just consider the 100D feature vector as 100 features to my classifier.</p>

<p>I now want to add a function to the class to allow adding documents to the corpus and updating the model accordingly.
I've found <code>dictionary.add_documents</code>, and <code>model.add_documents</code>, but there are two things that aren't clear to me:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you originally create the LSI model, one of the parameters the function receives is <code>id2word=dictionary</code>. When updating the model, how do you tell it to use the updated dictionary? Is it actually unnecessary, or will it make a difference?</li>
<li>How do I update the index? It looks from the <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/similarities/docsim.html#gensim.similarities.docsim.Similarity.add_documents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation</a> that if I use the <code>Similarity</code> class, and not the <code>MatrixSimilarity</code> class, I can add documents to the index, but I don't see such functionality for <code>MatrixSimilarity</code>. If I understood correctly, the <code>MatrixSimilarity</code> is better if my input corpus contains dense vectors (which is does, because I'm using the LSI model). Do I have to change it to <code>Similarity</code> just so that I can update the index? Or, conversely, what's the complexity of creating this index? If it's insignificant, should I just create a new index with my updated corpus, as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>self.dictionary.add_documents(new_docs)    # new_docs is already after filtering stop words
new_corpus = [self.dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in new_docs]
self.lsi.add_documents(new_corpus)
self.index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(self.lsi[self.corpus])

I found <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/49802495/1150683"">this informative answer</a> which indicates that we can load pre_trained models like so:</p>

<pre><code>import gensim
from torch import nn

model = gensim.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('path/to/file')
weights = torch.FloatTensor(model.vectors)
emb = nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(torch.FloatTensor(weights.vectors))
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work correctly, also on 1.0.1. My question is, that I don't quite understand what I have to feed into such a layer to utilise it. Can I just feed the tokens (segmented sentence)? Do I need a mapping, for instance token-to-index? </p>

<p>I found that you can access a token's vector simply by something like</p>

<pre><code>print(weights['the'])
# [-1.1206588e+00  1.1578362e+00  2.8765252e-01 -1.1759659e+00 ... ]
</code></pre>

<p>What does that mean for an RNN architecture? Can we simply load in the tokens of the batch sequences? For instance:</p>

<pre><code>for seq_batch, y in batch_loader():
    # seq_batch is a batch of sequences (tokenized sentences)
    # e.g. [['i', 'like', 'cookies'],['it', 'is', 'raining'],['who', 'are', 'you']]
    output, hidden = model(seq_batch, hidden)
</code></pre>

<p>This does not seem to work so I am assuming you need to convert the tokens to its index in the final word2vec model. Is that true? I found that you can get the indices of words by using the word2vec model's <code>vocab</code>:</p>

<pre><code>weights.vocab['world'].index
# 147
</code></pre>

<p>So as an input to an Embedding layer, should I provide a tensor of <code>int</code> for a sequence of sentences that consist of a sequence of words? Example use with dummy dataloader (cf. example above) and dummy RNN welcome.</p>

<p>In addition, after I looked at the source code in gensim package, I found that when I use Doc2vec.load(), the Doc2vec class doesn't really have a load() function by itself, but since it is a subclass of Word2vec, it calls the super method of load() in Word2vec and then make the model m a Word2vec object. However, the infer_vector() function is unique to Doc2vec and does not exist in Word2vec, and that's why it is causing the error. I also tried casting the model m to a Doc2vec, but I got this error:</p>

<p>What are these <code>docvecs</code> then? How do I get the output desired, which is a matrix of dimensions (40, 10) in this example?</p>

<p>I saw this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31321209/doc2vec-how-to-get-document-vectors"">here</a>, and the correct answer says at the bottom ""where 99 is the document id whose vector we want.""

(2) I can use embeddings to compare similarity between two things(could be word or phrase)</p>
<p>So far I have tried two paths:</p>
<p>1: Some Gensim-loaded pre-trained models, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>from gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec
import gensim.downloader as api
# download the model and return as object ready for use
model_glove_twitter = api.load(&quot;fasttext-wiki-news-subwords-300&quot;)
model_glove_twitter.similarity('computer-science', 'machine-learning')
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this path is that I do not know if a phrase has embedding. For this example, I got this error:</p>
<pre><code>KeyError: &quot;word 'computer-science' not in vocabulary&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>I will have to try different pre-trained models, such as word2vec-google-news-300, glove-wiki-gigaword-300, glove-twitter-200, etc. Results are similar, there are always phrases of interests not having embeddings.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Then I tried to use some BERT-based sentence embedding method: <a href=""https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers</a>.</li>

<pre><code>from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

    # Calculate the cosine similarity of the two embeddings.

phrase_1 = 'baby girl'
phrase_2 = 'annual report'
embedding_1 = model.encode(phrase_1)
embedding_2 = model.encode(phrase_2)
cosine_similarity(embedding_1[0], embedding_2[0])
</code></pre>
<p>Using this method I was able to get embeddings for my phrases, but the similarity score was 0.93, which did not seem to be reasonable.</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing is that I have no idea on how to extract positive/negative/polarity percentages from this implementation of word2vec. The code delivers an accuracy rate so I presume it must check the predicted value (POS/NEG) against the known value (in this case an entire .txt is filled with either POS or NEG). So my approach would be to get the predicted POS/NEG rating per document(in this case per review), then of course simply add those up (the number of ratings, I mean) and divide POS and NEG from it to get a percentage. This percentage would then cover all documents in that file. From this, the polarity could perhaps also be calculated but I'm trying to figure POS/NEG out first.</p>

<p>Would anyone have any idea on how to get those predicted ratings? Below is the post-vectorisation code, but it's rather similar (cough) to the standard used.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Everything is great with unigrams, but when I run with bigrams, I start to get topics with repeated information. For example, Topic 1 might contain: <code>['good product', 'good value']</code>, and Topic 4 might contain: <code>['great product', 'great value']</code>. To a human these are obviously conveying the same information, but obviously <code>'good product'</code> and <code>'great product'</code> are distinct bigrams. How do I algorithmically determine that <code>'good product'</code> and <code>'great product'</code> are similar enough, so I can translate all occurrences of one of them to the other (maybe the one that appears more often in the corpus)?</p>

<p><strong>What I've tried:</strong> I played around with WordNet's Synset tree, with little luck. It turns out that <code>good</code> is an 'adjective', but <code>great</code> is an 'adjective satellite', and therefore return <code>None</code> for path similarity. My thought process was to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Part of speech tag the sentence</li>
<li>Use these POS to find the correct Synset</li>
<li>Compute similarity of the two Synsets</li>
<li>If they are above some threshold, compute occurrences of both words</li>
<li>Replace the least occurring word with the most occurring word</li>
</ol>

<p>Ideally, though, I'd like an algorithm that can determine that <code>good</code> and <code>great</code> are similar <em>in my corpus</em> (perhaps in a co-occurring sense), so that it can be extended to words that aren't part of the general English language, but appear in my corpus, and so that it can be extended to n-grams (maybe <code>Oracle</code> and <code>terrible</code> are synonymous in my corpus, or <code>feature engineering</code> and <code>feature creation</code> are similar).</p>

<p>Any suggestions on algorithms, or suggestions to get WordNet synset to behave?</p>

<p>At the beginning of my project, the focus was to compare requests/questions received in terms of how they differ in terms of content. I trained a <code>Doc2Vec</code> model and the results were pretty good (for reference, my data included 14 million requests).</p>
<pre><code>class PhrasingIterable():
    def __init__(self, my_phraser, texts):
        self.my_phraser = my_phraser 
        self.texts = texts
    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.my_phraser[self.texts])

docs = DocumentIterator()
bigram_transformer = Phrases(docs, min_count=1, threshold=10)
bigram = Phraser(bigram_transformer)
corpus = PhrasingIterable(bigram, docs)
sentences = [TaggedDocument(doc, [i]) for i, doc in enumerate(corpus)]    
model = Doc2Vec(window=5,
                        vector_size=300,
                        min_count=10,
                        workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count(),
                        epochs = 10, 
                        compute_loss=True)
model.build_vocab(sentences)
model.train(sentences, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=model.epochs)
</code></pre>
<p>However, in a second stage, the focus of analysis shifted from requests to individuals per week. To measure how individuals requests differ from week to week I extracted all words from requests in a given week t and compared with all words from requests in the previous week t-1 using <code>d2v_model.wv.n_similarity</code>. Since I need to replicate this in other areas, occurred to me that I was wasting to much memory and time training <code>Doc2Vec</code> models when I could use <code>Word2Vec</code> to get the same measure. Thus, I trained the following <code>Word2Vec</code> model:</p>
<pre><code>docs = DocumentIterator()
bigram_transformer = gensim.models.Phrases(docs, min_count=1, threshold=10)
bigram = gensim.models.phrases.Phraser(bigram_transformer)
sentences = PhrasingIterable(bigram, docs)
model = Word2Vec(window=5,
                        size=300,
                        min_count=10,
                        workers = multiprocessing.cpu_count(),
                        iter = 10, 
                        compute_loss=True)
model.build_vocab(sentences)
model.train(sentences, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=model.epochs)
</code></pre>
<p>I used again the cosine similarity to compare the content from week to week <code>w2v_model.wv.n_similarity</code>. As a sanity check, I compared the similarities generated by <code>Word2Vec</code> and <code>Doc2vec</code>, the correlation coefficient among is around 0.70 and the scale differs a lot. My implied assumption is that comparing sets of extracted words using <code>d2v_model.wv.n_similarity</code> was taking advantage of the <code>Word2Vec</code> within the trained <code>Doc2Vec</code>.</p>
<p><strong>MY QUESTION</strong></p>
<p>Should cosine similarity measures between two sets of extracted words differ as we trade from <code>Doc2Vec</code> to <code>Word2Vec</code>? If so, why? I not, any suggestions on my code?</p>

<p>Are there any ways to deal with additional information when comparing using word vectors? When I know that some subset of the text can provide better match.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPD: edited the code above to make it more clear.</p>

<p><code>vectorize_query</code> in my case does so called smooth inverse frequency weighting, when word vectors from GloVe model (that can be word2vec as well, etc.) are added with weights <code>a/(a+w)</code>, where w should be the word frequency. I use there word's inverse tfidf score, i.e. <code>w = 1/tfidf(word)</code>. Coefficient <code>a</code> is typically taken 1e-3 in this approach. Taking just tfidf score as weight instead of that fraction gives almost similar result, I also played with normalization, etc. </p>

<p>But I wanted to have just ""vectorize sentence"" in my example to not overload the question as I think it does not depend on how I add word vectors using weighting theme - the problem is only that comparison works best when sentences have approximately the same number of meaning words.</p>

<p>I am aware of another approach when distance between sentence and text is being computed using the sum or mean of minimal pairwise word distances, e.g.
""Obama speaks to the media in Illinois"" &lt;-> ""The President greets the press in Chicago"" where we have <code>dist = d(Obama, president) + d(speaks, greets) + d(media, press) + d(Chicago, Illinois).</code> But this approach does not take into account that adjective can change the meaning of noun significantly, etc - which is more or less incorporated in vector models. Words like adjectives  'good', 'bad', 'nice', etc. become noise there, as they match in two texts and contribute as zero or low distances, thus decreasing the distance between sentence and text. </p>

<p>I played a bit with doc2vec models, it seems it was gensim doc2vec implementation and <code>skip-thoughts</code> embedding, but in my case (matching short query with much bigger amount of text) I had unsatisfactory results.</p>

<p>May I ask what is the word pair when the sentence contains only one word? </p>

<p>Is it  ""Happy!"" ==> [(happy,happy)] ?</p>

<p>I tested the word2vec algorithm in genism, when there is just one word in the training set sentences, (and this word is not included in other sentences), the word2vec algorithm can still construct an embedding vector for this specific word. I am not sure how the algorithm is able to do so.</p>

<p>As the answer posted below, I think the word embedding vector created for the word in the 1-word-sentence is just the random initialization of neural network weights.</p>

<p>The way I processed my test data was that I extracted all the sentences from the text files in the test folder, and I turned it into a giant list of sentences. After that, I used a function that I though was the right one (turns out it wasn't as it gave me this error: <strong>TypeError: don't know how to handle uri</strong>). Here is how I went about doing this:</p>

<pre><code>test_filenames = glob.glob('./testing/*.txt')

print(""Found corpus of %s safety/incident reports:"" %len(test_filenames))

test_corpus_raw = u""""
for text_file in test_filenames:
    txt_file = open(text_file, 'r')
    test_corpus_raw += unicode(txt_file.readlines())
print(""Test Corpus is now {0} characters long"".format(len(test_corpus_raw)))

test_raw_sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(test_corpus_raw)

def sentence_to_wordlist(raw):
    clean = re.sub(""[^a-zA-Z]"","" "", raw)
    words = clean.split()
    return words

test_sentences = []
for raw_sentence in test_raw_sentences:
    if len(raw_sentence) &gt; 0:
        test_sentences.append(sentence_to_wordlist(raw_sentence))

test_token_count = sum([len(sentence) for sentence in test_sentences])
print(""The test corpus contains {0:,} tokens"".format(test_token_count))


####### THIS LAST LINE PRODUCES AN ERROR: TypeError: don't know how to handle uri 
texts2vec.wv.accuracy(test_sentences, case_insensitive=True)

<p>I have no idea how to fix this last part. Please help. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>So i have a model that looks like this</p>
<pre><code>w2v_model = gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec(size=300, 
                                        window=7,

                                        workers=8)
</code></pre>
<p>I also tokenize my x_train and x_test like this</p>
<pre><code>x_train = pad_sequences(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(df_train.text), maxlen=300)
x_test = pad_sequences(tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(df_test.text), maxlen=300)
</code></pre>
<p>My embedding layer looks like this</p>
<pre><code>embedding_matrix = np.zeros((vocab_size, 300), dtype='float32')
 for word, i in tokenizer.word_index.items():
  if word in w2v_model.wv:
    embedding_matrix[i] = w2v_model.wv[word]

embedding_layer = Embedding(vocab_size, 300, weights=[embedding_matrix], input_length=300, 
trainable=False)
</code></pre>
<p>So I get that the 300 in the model is the dimension size and the 300 in the pad_sequences is the max sequence length aka max sentence length</p>
<p>I also get that the 300 in the embedding_matrix definition is the w2v dimension size again and that the first 300 in the embedding_layer is referring to the w2v dimension size</p>
<p>and the second 300 would be the max input length aka the same as the max length in the pad_sequences but what I don't get is.</p>
<p>If my dimensional size of my w2v model equals to let's say 240, does this mean my pad_sequences maxlen should also be 240 and also the input_length in my embedding_layer?</p>
<p>For example, the w2v size is 300 but my sentence length that I want to predict is 360 and my pad_sequences maxlen would be 500. Would my neural net be able to correctly predict this sentence of length 360?</p>

But I'm interested in knowing how to implement it myself.
The explanation from the <a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/paragraph_vector.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official paper</a> for PV-DBOW is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another way is to ignore the context words in the input, but force the model to predict words randomly sampled from the paragraph in the output. In reality, what this means is that at each iteration of stochastic gradient descent, we sample a text window, then sample a random word from the text window and form a classification task given the Paragraph Vector.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the paper the word vectors are not stored
and PV-DBOW is said to work similar to skip gram in word2vec.</p>

<p>Skip-gram is explained in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">word2vec Parameter Learning</a>.
In the skip gram model the word vectors are mapped to the hidden layer.
The matrix that performs this mapping is updated during the training.
In PV-DBOW the dimension of the hidden layer should be the dimension of one paragraph vector. When I want to multiply the word vector of a sampled example with the paragraph vector they should have the same size.
The original representation of a word is of size (vocabulary size x 1). Which mapping is performed to get the right size (paragraph dimension x 1)
in the hidden layer. And how is this mapping performed when the word vectors are not stored?
I assume that word and paragraph representation should have the same size in the hidden layer because of equation 26 in <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">word2vec Parameter Learning</a></p>

<p>I am working on identifying noun-adjective (or ) relationships within the word embeddings.</p>

<p>(E.g. we have 'nice car' in a sentence of the data-set. Given the word embeddings of the corpus and the nouns and adjectives all labeled, I am trying to design a technique to find the proper vector that connects 'nice' with 'car'.)</p>

<p>Of course I am not trying to connect only that pair of words, but the technique should would for all  relationships. A supervised approach is taken at this moment, then try to work towards designing an unsupervised method.</p>

<p>Now that you understand what I am trying to do, I will explain the problem. I obviously know that word2vec needs to be trained on large amounts of data, to learn the proper embeddings as accurately as possible, but I am afraid to give it more data than the data-set with labelled  sentences (500-700).</p>

<p>I am afraid that if I give it more data to train on (e.g. Latest Wikipedia dump data-set), it will learn better vectors, but the extra data will influence the positioning of my  words, then this word relationship is biased by the extra training data. (e.g. what if there is also 'nice Apple' in the extra training data, then the positioning of the word 'nice' could be compromised).</p>

<p>Hopefully this makes sense and I am not making bad assumptions, but I am just in the dilemma of having bad vectors because of not enough training data, or having good vectors, but compromised  vector positioning in the word embeddings.</p>

<p>What would be the proper way to train on ? As much training data as possible (billions of words) or just the labelled data-set (500-700 sentences) ?</p>

<p>Thank you kindly for your time, and let me know if anything that I explained does not make sense.</p>

"35616088","1","54973464","","2016-02-25 00:40:27","","11","3518","<p>I am looking at the <code>DeepDist</code> (<a href=""http://deepdist.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>) module and thinking to combine it with <code>Gensim</code>'s <code>Doc2Vec</code> API to train paragraph vectors on <code>PySpark</code>. The link actually provides with the following clean example for how to do it for <code>Gensim</code>'s <code>Word2Vec</code> model:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from deepdist import DeepDist
from gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext()
corpus = sc.textFile('enwiki').map(lambda s: s.split())

def gradient(model, sentences):  # executes on workers
    syn0, syn1 = model.syn0.copy(), model.syn1.copy()   # previous weights
    model.train(sentences)
    return {'syn0': model.syn0 - syn0, 'syn1': model.syn1 - syn1}

def descent(model, update):      # executes on master
    model.syn0 += update['syn0']
    model.syn1 += update['syn1']

with DeepDist(Word2Vec(corpus.collect()) as dd:
    dd.train(corpus, gradient, descent)
    print dd.model.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man']) 
</code></pre>

<p>To my understanding, <code>DeepDist</code> is distributing the work of gradient descent into workers in batches, and the recombining them and updating at master. If I replace <code>Word2Vec</code> with <code>Doc2Vec</code>, there should be the document vectors that are being trained with the word vectors.</p>

<p>So I looked into the source code of <code>gensim.models.doc2vec</code> (<a href=""https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/doc2vec.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>). There are the following fields in the <code>Doc2Vec</code> model instance:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>model.syn0</code></li>
<li><code>model.syn0_lockf</code></li>
<li><code>model.docvecs.doctag_syn0</code></li>
<li><code>model.docvecs.doctag_syn0_lockf</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Comparing with the source code of <code>gensim.models.word2vec</code> (<a href=""https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/models/word2vec.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>), the following fields went missing in <code>Doc2Vec</code> model:</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><code>model.syn1</code></li>
<li><code>model.syn1neg</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I think I do not touch the <code>lockf</code> vectors because they seem to be used after the training is done when new data points come in. Therefore my code should be something like </p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from deepdist import DeepDist
from gensim.models.doc2vec import Doc2Vec, LabeledSentence
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext()

# assume my dataset is in format 10-char-id followed by doc content
# 1 line per doc
corpus = sc.textFile('data_set').map(
    lambda s: LabeledSentence(words=s[10:].split(),labels=s[:10])
)

def gradient(model, sentence):  # executes on workers
    syn0, doctag_syn0 = model.syn0.copy(), model.docvecs.doctag_syn0.copy()   # previous weights
    model.train(sentence)
    return {'syn0': model.syn0 - syn0, 'doctag_syn0': model.docvecs.doctag_syn0 - doctag_syn0}

def descent(model, update):      # executes on master
    model.syn0 += update['syn0']
    model.docvecs.doctag_syn0 += update['doctag_syn0']

with DeepDist(Doc2Vec(corpus.collect()) as dd:
    dd.train(corpus, gradient, descent)
    print dd.model.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man']) 
</code></pre>

<p>Am I missing anything important here? For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I care about <code>model.syn1</code> at all? What do they mean after all?</li>
<li>Am I right that <code>model.*_lockf</code> is the locked matrices after training?</li>
<li>Is it ok that I use <code>lambda s: LabeledSentence(words=s[10:].split(),labels=s[:10]</code> to parse my dataset, assuming I have each document in one line, prefixed by a 0-padded 10-digit id?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestion/contribution are very appreciated. I will write up a blog post to summarize the result, mentioning contributors here, potentially to help others train Doc2Vec models on scaled distributed systems without spending much dev time trying to solve what I am solving now.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<hr>

<p>Update 06/13/2018</p>

<p>My apologies as I did not get to implement this. But there are better options nowaday, and <code>DeepDist</code> haven't been maintained for awhile now. Please read comment below.</p>

I need to get <strong>the topic distribution of a corpus</strong>, not the individual documents.
Let say I have 1000 documents, which belongs to 10 different categories (let say 100 docs for each category).
After training the LDA model overall 1000 documents, then I want to see what are <strong>the dominant topics</strong> of each category. The following image illustrates my dataset and aim.</p>

<p>So far I can think of two approaches, but I am not sure either is sane, I will be happy to know if there is a better way of doing it.</p>

<p>In the first approach, I can concatenate the documents of each category into one large document. So there will be only 10 large documents, hence for each document, I will be able to retrieve its topic distribution. </p>

<p>Another approach might be getting the topic distribution of all document, without concatenating documents. Hence for each category, we will have 100 documents topic distributions. To get the dominant topics for each category, I may sum the probability of each topic, and get only a few highest scored topics.
I am not sure any of this approaches are right, what would you suggest?</p>

Each novel is a txt file, already preprocessed and read into python using the <code>read()</code> method, so that it appears as a ""<code>long string</code>"". If I try to tag each novel using TaggedDocument form gensim, each novel gets only one tag, and the corpus of tagged documents has only six elements (which is not enough to train the doc2vec model). </p>

<p>I have been suggested to split each novel into sentences, then assign each sentence one tag for the ID of the sentence, and then one tag for the ID of the book it belongs to. I am, however, in trouble since I do not know how to structure the code.</p>

<p>This was the first code, i.e. the one using each novel in the format of a ""<code>long string</code>"":</p>

<pre><code>    `documents=[emma_text, persuasion_text, prideandprejudice_text,   
     janeeyre_text, shirley_text, professor_text] 
     corpus=[]`

    `for docid, document in enumerate(documents):
         corpus.append(TaggedDocument(document.split(), tags=
         [""{0:0&gt;4}"".format  
         (docid)]))`    

     `d2v_model = Doc2Vec(vector_size=100, 
                window=15,
                hs=0,
                sample=0.000001,
                min_count=100,
                workers=-1,
                epochs=500,
                dm=0, 
                dbow_words=1) 

    d2v_model.build_vocab(corpus)`

    `d2v_model.train(corpus, total_examples=d2v_model.corpus_count,    
     epochs=d2v_model.epochs)`
</code></pre>

<p>This, however, means that my corpus of tagged documents has only six elements and that my model has not enough elements on which to train. If for instance I try to apply the <code>.most_similar</code> method to a target book, I get completely wrong results</p>

<p>To sum up, I need help to assign each sentence of each book (I have already split the books into sentences) one tag for the ID of the sentence and one tag for the ID of the book it belongs to, using TaggedDocument to build the corpus on which I will train my model.</p>

<p>Expected result: much faster code</p>

<h3>Some more background on the question</h3>

<p>The original code is at <a href=""https://github.com/skipgram/modern-nlp-in-python/blob/master/executable/Modern_NLP_in_Python.ipynb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/skipgram/modern-nlp-in-python/blob/master/executable/Modern_NLP_in_Python.ipynb</a>. The example code is taken from the phrase modelling section</p>

<p>I'm calculating the unigrams. All reviews are at  </p>

<pre><code>review_txt_filepath = os.path.join(intermediate_directory,'review_text_all.txt'),
</code></pre>

<p>all unigrams should go to</p>

<pre><code>unigram_sentences_filepath = os.path.join(intermediate_directory, 'unigram_sentences_all.txt') 
</code></pre>

<p>The crucial routines are</p>

<pre><code>def punct_space(token):
    return token.is_punct or token.is_space

def line_review(filename):
    # generator function to read in reviews from the file
    with codecs.open(filename, encoding='utf_8') as f:
        for review in f:
            yield review.replace('\\n', '\n')

def lemmatized_sentence_corpus(filename):
    # generator function to use spaCy to parse reviews, lemmatize the text, and yield sentences

    for parsed_review in nlp.pipe(line_review(filename),
                              batch_size=10000, n_threads=4):
        for sent in parsed_review.sents:
            yield u' '.join([token.lemma_ for token in sent
                             if not punct_space(token)])
</code></pre>

<p>The unigrams are calculated as</p>

<pre><code>with codecs.open(unigram_sentences_filepath, 'w', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    for sentence in lemmatized_sentence_corpus(review_txt_filepath):
        f.write(sentence + '\n')
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this for 5000 lines requires some patience, 1h30m ;-)</p>

<p>I'm not that familiar with iterables, but do I understand it correctly that I first have to read the 
actual file (on disc) into a variable ""list_of_data"" and process that</p>

<pre><code>with (review_txt_filepath, 'r', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    list_of_data = f.read()

with codecs.open(unigram_sentences_filepath, 'w', encoding='utf_8') as f:
    for sentence in lemmatized_sentence_corpus(list_of_data):
        f.write(sentence + '\n')
</code></pre>

<p>So the strategy is</p>

<pre><code>1. read all data into a list in memory
2. process the data
3. write the results to disc
4. delete the list from memory by setting list_with_data = ()
</code></pre>

<p>A problem with this is obviously that line_review is doing the file reading               </p>

This model has most commonly been applied to natural language by concatenating giant collections of text. These documents of are often concatenated into a single very long line of text, with no distinction of when a new document begins and ends. This ends up not being much of an issue in NLP because the percentage of the model training instances involving overlapping documents is a small percentage of the total number of instances. In Education data, this overlap can be much higher because of shorter sequences and high numbers of users (formerly ""documents"" in NLP). This is also a problem in other behavioral datasets, not just education. The problem manifests itself when inspecting the learned vectors and finding that the model has determined that many of the students' first encountered elements are very similar to the students' very last encountered elements. This is a bi-product of the ""wrapping"" of lines in the input to gensim (instances spanning the end of one student's sequence and the beginning of another). How can I identify where in the code this overlapping occurs and prohibit this overlap from happening during training in gensim. </p>

<p>In the ""regular"" Gensim LdaModel it says that if one sets alpha = 'asymmetric', Gensim uses a ""fixed normalized asymmetric prior of 1.0 / topicno"" (topicno is num_topics, right?!). But why it is called asymmetric? Isn't that the symmetric case? (see <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html</a>)</p>

<p>And whats the default number for alpha used by Mallet? 50? If so, why? As far as i know one should choose some value &lt;1 to get good results.

My understanding was that Word2Vec was deterministic, and that the position of a word in a vector space would not change from training to training. If ""My cat is running"" and ""your dog can't be running"" are the two sentences in the corpus, then the value of ""running"" (or its stem) seems necessarily fixed.</p>

<p>However, I've found that that value indeed does vary across models, and words keep changing where they are on a vector space when I train the model. The differences are not always hugely meaningful, but they do indicate the existence of some random process. What am I missing here?</p>

Subject: Request for submission of variation worksharing procedure for Xatral (alfuzosin) 


and related names  





Dear Dr Maty Lecchi, 



During the March meeting, the pqr was informed that separate national and MRP variations have 


been submitted across EU Member States to request the inclusion of the below contraindication for 


Xatral (alfuzosin) and related names: 



Section 4.3 


Concomitant intake of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (see paragraph 4.5). 





The parallel submissions in several Member States have led to a disharmonised assessment of the 


contraindication. In the interest of public health across the Panthers Union, the pqr requests xxx 


to re-submit the variation as a worksharing application including all MRP, DCP and nationally 


authorised products to harmonise the assessment of the contraindication in section 4.3 of the SmPC 


across the EU. 


Please note that a separate letter on an independent issue to this has been sent to Esther de Bles, 


xxx-yy Netherlands B.V.. However, there are general concerns by the pqr on the lack of use 


of variation worksharing by xxx-yy in these cases.  



Kind Regards, 







Laura Oliveira Santamaria 


Chair of pqr

I trained the model once on OldDataSet.csv and measured coherence.  I have been using it to pass NewDataSet.csv through for topic allocation.  I need some guidance on how I might be able to predict how accurately my pre-trained model is allocating NewDataSet.csv.  That coherence score only checks the accuracy of the pre-trained model not the allocated data set.  I'd like a way to  track the occurrence of historical topics and detect the emergence of new topics without re-training the model.  Like say these are the topics in OldDataSet.csv:</p>

<ol>
<li>whiskey</li>
<li>Tango</li>
<li>Foxtrot</li>
</ol>

<p>It will assign NewDataSet.csv 1. whiskey 2. Tango or 3. Foxtrot but a more accurate allocation might be:</p>

<ol>
<li>whiskey</li>
<li>Tango</li>
<li>Alpha</li>
</ol>

<p>If I keep running the same model I might miss this new topic.  If there exists a numeric score that would measure how closely the topics adhere to NewDataSet.csv that would be a huge time saver.  Thanks Stack you always save me :)</p>

<p><code>Gensim</code> has a method to calculate distances between topics <code>model.diff(model)</code>, but unfortunately cosine distance is not implemented; it has jaccard distance, but it is a bit too vector-length dependent (i.e., when comparing top 100 most important words per topic the distance is lower than comparing top 500, and the distance is 0 when full-length vectors are compared, as each topic includes all terms, but with different probabilities).</p>

<p>My problem is that the output from the model looks like this (only shown 4 top words):</p>

<pre><code>(30, '0.008*""tax"" + 0.004*""cut"" + 0.004*""bill"" + 0.004*""spending""')
(18, '0.009*""candidate"" + 0.009*""voter"" + 0.009*""vote"" + 0.009*""election""')

(22, '0.023*""boat"" + 0.020*""ship"" + 0.015*""migrant"" + 0.013*""vessel""')

<p>So, in order to calculate the cosine sim/distance, I would have to parse the second element of the tuple (i.e., the  <code>'0.008*""tax"" +...'</code> part, which indicates term probabilities. </p>

<p>I was wondering whether there is an easier way to get cosine similarity out of the model? Or parsing each individual string of term/probabilities is really the only way to go?</p>

The reasons are simple: first of all, I already have a great deal of vectorized data; second, I prefer the interface and flexibility of scikit-learn vectorizers; third, even though topic modelling with gensim is very fast, computing its dictionaries (<code>Dictionary()</code>) is relatively slow in my experience.</p>

<p>Similar questions have been asked before, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19504898/use-sikit-tfidf-with-gensim-lda"">especially here</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15670525/how-do-you-initialize-a-gensim-corpus-variable-with-a-csr-matrix"">here</a>, and the bridging solution is gensim's <code>Sparse2Corpus()</code> function which transforms a Scipy sparse matrix into a gensim corpus object.</p>

<p>However, this conversion does not make use of the <code>vocabulary_</code> attribute of sklearn vectorizers, which holds the mapping between words and feature ids. This mapping is necessary in order to print the discriminant words for each topic (<code>id2word</code> in gensim topic models, described as ""a a mapping from word ids (integers) to words (strings)"").</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that gensim's <code>Dictionary</code> objects are much more complex (and slower to compute) than scikit's <code>vect.vocabulary_</code> (a simple Python <code>dict</code>)...</p>

<p>Any ideas to use <code>vect.vocabulary_</code> as <code>id2word</code> in gensim models?</p>

the model provides a representation for the phrase <code>AuM Wert</code>.<br>

for word in docs4:</p>

<pre><code>if word in word_counter:

<p>I have a small number of literary texts (novels) and would like to extract some general topics using LDA.</p>

<p>I'm using the <code>gensim</code> module in Python along with some <code>nltk</code> features. For a test I've split up my original texts (just 6) into 30 chunks with 1000 words each. Then I converted the chunks into document-term matrices and ran the algorithm. This is the code (although I think it doesn't matter for the question) :</p>

<pre><code># chunks is a 30x1000 words matrix

dictionary = gensim.corpora.dictionary.Dictionary(chunks)
corpus = [ dictionary.doc2bow(chunk) for chunk in chunks ]
lda = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus = corpus, id2word = dictionary,
    num_topics = 10)
topics = lda.show_topics(5, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>However the result is completely different from any example I've seen in that the topics are full of meaningless words that can be found in <em>all</em> source documents, e.g. ""I"", ""he"", ""said"", ""like"", ... example:</p>

<pre><code>[(2, '0.009*""I"" + 0.007*""\'s"" + 0.007*""The"" + 0.005*""would"" + 0.004*""He""'), 
(8, '0.012*""I"" + 0.010*""He"" + 0.008*""\'s"" + 0.006*""n\'t"" + 0.005*""The""'), 
(9, '0.022*""I"" + 0.014*""\'s"" + 0.009*""``"" + 0.007*""\'\'"" + 0.007*""like""'), 
(7, '0.010*""\'s"" + 0.009*""I"" + 0.006*""He"" + 0.005*""The"" + 0.005*""said""'), 
(1, '0.009*""I"" + 0.009*""\'s"" + 0.007*""n\'t"" + 0.007*""The"" + 0.006*""He""')]
</code></pre>

<p>I don't quite understand why that happens, or why it doesn't happen with the examples I've seen. How do I get the LDA model to find more distinctive topics with less overlap? Is it a matter of filtering out more common words first? How can I adjust how many times the model runs? Is the number of original texts too small?</p>

text=""Victor Marie Hugo, Romantik akıma bağlı Fransız şair, romancı ve oyun yazarı. En büyük ve ünlü Fransız yazarlardan biri kabul edilir. Hugo'nun Fransa'daki edebi ünü ilk olarak şiirlerinden sonra da romanlarından ve tiyatro oyunlarından gelir. Pek çok şiirinin içinde özellikle Les Contemplations ve La Légende des siècles büyük saygı görür. Fransa dışında en çok Sefiller ve Notre Dame'ın Kamburu romanlarıyla tanınır.Gençliğinde şiddetli bir kral yanlısı olsa da, görüşü yıllar içinde değişti ve tutkulu bir cumhuriyet destekçisi oldu. Eserleri zamanının politik ve sosyal sorunlarına ve de sanatsal akımlarına değinir. Hugo'nun cenazesi 1885'te Panthéon'da gömüldü. Hugo hakkında en çok eser yazılan ilk 100 kişi listesinde yer almaktadır. Victor Hugo, Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo (1773–1828) ve Sophie Trébuchet (1772–1821) çiftinin üçüncü oğluydu; Abel Joseph Hugo (1798–1855) ve Eugène Hugo (1800–1837) isminde iki ağabeyi vardı. 1802'de Besançon'da doğdu. Napolyon'un bir kahraman olduğunu düşünen serbest fikirli bir cumhuriyetçiydi. Annesi 1812'de Napolyon'a karşı komplo kurduğu için idam edilen General Victor Lahorie ile sevgili olduğu düşünülen Katolik bir Kralcıydı.Hugo'nun çocukluğu ülkede siyasi karmaşıklığın olduğu bir dönemde geçti. Doğumundan iki yıl sonra Napolyon İmparator ilan edilmiş, 18 yaşındayken de Bourbon Monarşisi yeniden tahta geçirilmişti. Hugo'nun ailesinin ters dini ve politik görüşleri Fransa'da egemenlik mücadelesi veren kuvvetleri yansıtıyordu. Hugo'nun babası İspanya'da yenilene kadar orduda yüksek rütbeli bir subaydı.Babası subay olduğu sürece aile sık sık taşındı ve bu yolculuklar sırasında Hugo pek çok şey öğrendi. Çocukluğunda Napoli'ye giderken geniş Alpler'deki geçitleri ve karlı zirveleri, muhteşem Akdeniz mavisini ve şenlikler yapılan Roma'yı gördü. 5 yaşında olmasına rağmen bu 6 aylık geziyi her zaman aklında tuttu. Aile Napoli'de birkaç ay kalıp doğruca Paris'e döndü.Hugo'nun annesi Sophie evliliğinin başında kocasına İtalya (Leopold Napoli'ye yakın bir vilayette valiydi) ve İspanya'ya (üç vilayette görev almıştı) kadar eşlik etti. Askeri hayatın getirdiği yorucu yolculuklar ve kocasının inancının zayıflığı nedeniyle ters düşmelerinden dolayı Sophie 1803'te Leopold'dan bir süreliğine ayrılıp üç çocuğuyla Paris'e yerleşti. Bundan sonra Hugo'nun eğitimi ve yetişmesi üzerine eğildi. Bu yüzden Hugo'nun kariyerinin ilk dönemindeki şiir ve kurgu çalışmaları annesinin inancının ve krala bağlılığının yansımasıydı. Ama başını Fransa'daki 1848 Devrimi'nin çektiği olaylar sırasında Katolik Kralcı yanlısı eğitime başkaldırıp Cumhuriyetçiliği ve Özgür düşünceyi desteklemeye başladı.Gençliğinde aşık oldu ve annesinin isteklerine karşı gelip çocukluk arkadaşı Adèle Foucher (1803–1868) ile gizlice nişanlandı. Annesi ile yakın ilişkisinden dolayı Adèle ile evlenmek için annesinin ölümüne (1821) kadar bekledi ve 1822'de evlendi.Adèle ve Victor Hugo'nun ilk çocuğu Leopold 1823'te doğdu ama doğduktan kısa süre sonra öldü. Sonraki sene kızları 28 Ağustos 1824'te Léopoldine doğdu. Onu 4 Kasım 1826'da doğan Charles, 28 Ekim 1828'de doğan François-Victor, ve 24 Ağustos 1830'da doğan Adèle takip etti.Hugo'nun en büyük ve en sevdiği kızı Léopoldine, Charles Vacquerie ile evliliğinden kısa süre sonra 19 yaşındayken 1843'te öldü. 4 Eylül 1843'te Seine nehrinde boğuldu. Gemi alabaro olduğundan ağır eteği tarafından dibe doğru çekildi ve kocası Charles Vacquerie de onu kurtarmaya çalışırken öldü. O zaman metresi ile Fransa'nın güneyinde seyahat etmekte olan Hugo kızının ölümünü oturduğu cafede okuduğu bir gazeteden öğrendi. Kızının ölümü Hugo'yu oldukça harap etti.III. Napolyon'un 1851 yılının sonundaki askeri darbesi sebebiyle sürgüne çıktı. Fransa'dan ayrıldıktan sonra, Channel Adaları'na gitmeden önce kısa bir süre Brüksel'de yaşadı. 1852'den 1855'e kadar Jersey'de yaşadı. 1855'te 15 yıl yaşayacağı Guernsey'e taşındı. III. Napolyon 1859'da genel af ilan ettiğinde ülkesine dönme fırsatı elde ettiyse de sürgünde kalmayı tercih etti. Kaybedilen Fransa-Prusya Savaşı'nın sonucu olarak III. Napolyon iktidardan çekilmek zorunda kalınca ülkesine döndü. Paris Kuşatması'ndan sonra hayatının geri kalanını Fransa'da geçirmek için geri dönmeden önce tekrar Guernsey'e taşınıp 1872 ve 1873 arası orada kaldı. Hugo ilk romanını (Han d'Islande, 1823) evliliğinden bir yıl sonra yayımladı. Üç yıl sonra da ikinci romanı (Bug-Jargal, 1826) basıldı. 1829 ve 1840 arasında zamanının en iyi şairlerinden biri olarak ününü pekiştiren beş şiir kitabı (Les Orientales, 1829; Les Feuilles d'automne, 1831; Les Chants du crépuscule, 1835; Les Voix intérieures, 1837; ve Les Rayons et les ombres, 1840) yayınladı.""

<p>I would prefer gensim to not count those in towards the average. So, in the case of distances(), it should simply not return anything or something I can easily delete later before I compute the mean using numpy. In the case of n_similarity, gensim of course has to do it by itself....</p>

Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence,[3] machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data[4] – such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions,[5]:2 through building a model from sample inputs.

<p>I have a csv file of 8000 questions and answers and I have made an LSI model with 1000 topics, from a tfidf corpus, using gensim as follows. I only consider questions as part of the text not the answers.</p>
<pre><code>texts = [jieba.lcut(text) for text in document]
# tk = WhitespaceTokenizer() 
# texts = [tk.tokenize(text) for text in document]

corpus_lsi = lsi_model[tfidf_corpus]
index = similarities.SparseMatrixSimilarity(corpus_lsi, num_features = feature_cnt)
</code></pre>
<p>Before this I am also preprocessing the data by removing stopwords using nltk and replacing punctuations using regex and lemmatizing, using wordnet and nltk.</p>
<p>I understand that jieba is not a tokenizer suited for english because it tokenizes spaces as well like this:</p>
<pre><code>Sample: This is untokenized text
Tokenized: 'This',' ','is',' ','untokenized', ' ', 'text'
</code></pre>
<p>When I switch from jieba to nltk whitespace tokenizer, strange thing happens, my accuracy suddenly drops that is when I a new sentence using the following code I get worse results</p>
<pre><code>keyword = &quot;New sentence the similarity of which is to be found to the main corpus&quot;
kw_vector = dictionary.doc2bow(jieba.lcut(keyword)) # jieba.lcut can be replaced by tk.tokenize()
sim = index[lsi_model[tfidf[kw_vector]]]                         
x = [sim[i] for i in np.argsort(sim)[-2:]]
</code></pre>
<p>My understanding is that extra and useless words and characters like whitespaces should decrease accuracy but here I observe an opposite effect. What could be the possible reasons?</p>
<p>One possible explanation I came up with is that most of the questions are short only 5 to 6 words like</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the office address?</li>
<li>Who to contact for X?</li>
<li>Where to find document Y?</li>

<p>Since Doc2Vec is an unsupervised model there is no real evaluation possible except to test how it performs on your downstream task.
So, I created a small dataset containing about 200 target documents and 5 similar documents per target.</p>
<p>My idea is to calculate the cosine similarity for every document against all other documents in my test dataset and get top 5 similar documents per target document.</p>
<p>Is there an efficient way to create a cosine similarity matrix with Doc2Vec? The <code>most_similar</code> function is impractical as it retrieves every similar document used for training.</p>

<p>I am trying to implement the following code to create my own wordembedings:</p>

<pre><code>model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences)
</code></pre>

<p>with sentences being a list of sentences.
Since I can not pass thousands and thousands of sentences I need an iterator</p>

<pre><code># with mini batch_dir a directory with the text files
# MySentences is a class iterating over sentences.
sentences = MySentences(minibatch_dir) # a memory-friendly iterator
</code></pre>

<p>I found this solution by the creator of gensim:</p>

<pre><code>class MySentences(object):
    def __init__(self, dirname):
        self.dirname = dirname

    def __iter__(self):
        for fname in os.listdir(self.dirname):
            for line in open(os.path.join(self.dirname, fname)):
                yield line.split()
</code></pre>

<p>It does not work for me.
How can I create an iterator if I know how to get the list of sentences from every document?</p>

<p>And second very related question:
If I am aiming to compare documents similarity in a particular corpus, is always better to create from scratch word embeddings with all the documents of that particular corpus than using GloVec or word2vec? 
The amount of docs is around 40000.</p>

<p>Given a corpus I want to train it with an implementation of word2wec (Gensim). </p>

<p><em>Example</em>: 
(May not be ideal, but using it to elaborate the problem statement) </p>

<p>Suppose word 'A' is being used in 3 different contexts within the corpus : </p>

<pre><code>Context 1 : 1000 times

<p>If I change the frequency of 'A' in my corpus (ensuring no context is lost, i.e. 'A' is still being used at least once in all the contexts as in the original corpus), is the similarity between A snd B going to be the same ?</p>

So does gensim really calculate the log-probability in <code>lprob</code> or is it just a score for comparison purposes.</p>

<p>I would have calculated the log-probability as follows:

"39738327","1","39742604","","2016-09-28 04:54:24","","1","186","<p>I am trying to make a Apple Siri-like application in python in which you give it vocal commands or questions through a microphone, it determines the text version of the inputted audio, and then determines the appropriate action to take based on the meaning of the command/question. I am going to be using the Speech Recognition library to accept microphone input and convert from speech to text (via the IBM Watson Speech to Text API).</p>

<p>The main problem I have with it right now is that when I define an action for the app to execute when the appropriate command is given/question is asked, I don't know how to determine if the said command/question is denoting that action. Let me clarify what I mean by that with an example:</p>

<p>Say we have a action called <code>hello</code>. There are multiple ways for somebody to say ""hello"" to another person (or in this case, my application), such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Hello""</li>
<li>""Hi""</li>
<li>""Howdy""</li>
<li>...Etcetera...</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, I want all of these ways of saying ""hello"" to be classified under the action of <code>hello</code>. That is, when someone says ""hello"", ""hi"", or ""howdy"", the response for the action <code>hello</code> should be executed (most likely just the app saying ""hello"" back in this case).</p>

<p>My first thought on how to solve this was to supply the app with all of or the most common ways to say a certain command/question. So, if I follow the previous example, I would tell the computer that ""hello"", ""hi"", and ""howdy"" all meant the same thing: the <code>hello</code> action. However, this method has a couple flaws. First off, it simply wouldn't understand ways of saying ""hello"" that weren't hardcoded in, such as ""hey"". Second off, once the responses for new commands/questions start getting coded in, it would become very tedious entering all the ways to say a certain phrase.</p>

<p>So then, because of the aforementioned problems, I started looking into ways to calculate the similarities between a group of sentences, and a single query. I eventually came across the Gensim library for python. I looked into it and found some very promising information on complex processes such as latent semantic indexing/analysis (LSI/LSA) and Tf-idf. However, it seemed to me like these things were mainly for comparing documents with large word counts as they rely on the frequency of certain terms. Assuming this is true, these processes wouldn't really provide me with accurate results as the commands/questions given to my app will probably be about eight words on average. I could be completely wrong, after all I know very little about these processes.</p>

<p>I also discovered WordNet, and how to work with it in python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). It looks like it could be useful, but I'm not sure how.</p>

<p>So, finally, I guess my real question here is what would be the best solution to the problem I've mentioned? Should I use one of the methods I've mentioned? Or is there a better way to do what I want that I don't know about?</p>

<p>Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for the wordy explanation; I wanted to be sure I was clear :P</p>

<p>This means that the most likely topic for document_1 is 7, for document_2 is 19, and for document_3 is 4. The primary output that I would like to see is simply this most likely topic for each document. The way I'm doing this now is using a loop:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def get_max(doc):
        idx,l = zip(*doc)
        return idx[np.argmax(l)]

data['doc_topic'] = [get_max(doc) for doc in model.get_document_topics(model_corpus)]
</code></pre>
<p>I have around 80k documents in my data frame, so this code takes about 45 seconds to execute. But since gensim has already done all the computations, I keep thinking that that 45 seconds of computational time is simply spent on reorganizing data, so there must be a more efficient way of doing this.</p>
<p>If possible, a secondary output that would be nice to have is the document-topic matrix, such that each row corresponds to a document in my data frame, and each column represents the probability (or similarity) of the document to the topic. So this would yield a DxT matrix, where D is the number of documents, and T is the number of topics.</p>

<p>That is I do <code>model.docvecs['some_doc_id']</code> and <code>model.infer_vector(documents['some_doc_id'])</code>.</p>

<p>As you can see, they are not really similar. If the similarity is so terrible even for documents used for training, I can't even begin to try to infer unseen documents.</p>

<p>Training configuration:</p>

<pre><code>model = Doc2Vec(documents=documents, dm=1, size=100, window=6, alpha=0.1, workers=4, 
seed=44, sample=1e-5, iter=15, hs=0, negative=8, dm_mean=1, min_alpha=0.01, min_count=2)

<p>Inferring:</p>

<pre><code>model.infer_vector(tokens, steps=20, alpha=0.025)
</code></pre>

<p>Note on the side: Documents are always preprocessed the same way (I checked that the same list of tokens goes into training and into inferring).</p>

<p>Also I played with parameters around a bit, too, and results were similar. So if your suggestion would be something like ""try increasing or decreasing this or that training parameter"", I've most likely tried it. Maybe I just didn't come across the 'correct' parameters though.</p>

<p>Thanks for any suggestions as to what can I do to make it work better.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am willing and able to use any other available Python implementation of paragraph vectors (doc2vec). It doesn't have to be this one. If you know of another that can achieve better results.</p>

"56316903","1","56464767","","2019-05-26 19:53:31","","7","8665","<p>I am interested in calculating similarity between vectors, however this similarity has to be a number between 0 and 1. There are many questions concerning tf-idf and cosine similarity, all indicating that the value lies between 0 and 1. From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity#Soft_cosine_measure"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the case of information retrieval, the cosine similarity of two
  documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies (using
  tf–idf weights) cannot be negative. The angle between two term
  frequency vectors cannot be greater than 90°.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The peculiarity is that I wish to calculate the similarity between two vectors from two different word2vec models. These models have been aligned, though, so they should in fact represent their words in the same vector space. I can calculate the similarity between a word in <code>model_a</code> and a word in <code>model_b</code> like so</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import gensim as gs
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

model_a = gs.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(model_a_path, binary=False)
model_b = gs.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(model_b_path, binary=False)

vector_a = model_a[word_a].reshape(1, -1)
vector_b = model_b[word_b].reshape(1, -1)

sim = cosine_similarity(vector_a, vector_b).item(0)
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>sim</code> is then a similarity metric in the [-1,1] range. Is there a scientifically sound way to map this to the [0,1] range? Intuitively I would think that something like</p>

<pre><code>norm_sim = (sim + 1) / 2
</code></pre>

<p>is okay, but I'm not sure whether that is good practice with respect to the actual meaning of cosine similarity. If not, are other similarity metrics advised? </p>

<p>The reason why I am trying to get the values to be between 0 and 1 is because the data will be transferred to a colleague who will use it as a feature for her machine learning system, which expects all values to be between 0 and 1. Her intuition was to take the absolute value, but that seems to me to be a worse alternative because then you map opposites to be identical. Considering the actual meaning of cosine similarity, though, I might be wrong. So if taking the absolute value is the good approach, we can do that as well.</p>

<p>To test a number of hypothesis, I would love to</p>

<ul>
<li>generate the (target, context, +1) tuples differently, instead of the default sliding window.</li>
<li>generate the negative samples (target, random_context, -1) tuples based on some rules, instead of from random NCE draws.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, I can get the parse tree of a sentence and use parent-child relationship to generate tuples, which is a non-linear window(somebody already tried it in NLP research community, hand-coded ofc...). I can also get an antonyms dictionary to lookup and to generate more negative samples in addition to the random ones (not sure, may help with faster convergence).</p>

<p>The error had never occurred before I introduced gensim to my program. (Gensim without multiprocessing also works for me.)

<p>I don't think the <code>model</code> would be copied, because my OS (Mac OS X) should be using the copy-on-write strategy. I don't think it is related to memory synchronization either, because not a line of ""Begin working"" is printed, i.e. the <code>model</code> has not been accessed by my code. The error is in passing the <code>model</code> to the sub-processes.</p>

This is my first time using gensim so I'm not sure how this is done. It's nothing fancy but this is the code I have so far (model generation code ommited). I thought about scaling (minmax scaling with max/min in the union of  vectors) the inferred vectors (v1 and v2) but I don't think this would be correct approach.
The idea here is to compare two documents (with tokens likely to be in the corpus) and output a similarity score between them. I've seen a few Gensim's tutorials and they often compare a single string to the corpus' documents, which is not really the idea here.</p>

<h2>Corpora</h2>

<p>Some of the solutions that I have been experimenting with, is the <code>corpora</code> utility of <code>gensim</code>:  </p>

<pre><code>corpora = gensim.corpora.dictionary.Dictionary(sentences, prune_at=2000000)
print(corpora)
print(getKey(corpora,'am'))
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me a nice dictionary of the words, but this corpora vocabulary is not the same as the one created by the <code>word2vec</code> function mentioned above. </p>

<p>Once built for the whole dataset, I am training the model in the same fashion, iteratively, this way :</p>

<pre><code>fr_documents_lda = open(""documents_lda_40_rails_30_ruby_full.dat"", 'rb')

<p>right before
 </p>

<pre><code>corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in documents_lda]

<p> in the last piece of code. Finally, I tried setting the allow_update argument of doc2bow to True. Nothing works.</p>

<p>FYI, the size of my final dictionary is 85k. The size of my dictionary built only from the first chunk is 10k. The error occurs on the second iteration, when it passes in the else condition, when calling the update method.</p>

<p>The error is raised by the line  <code>expElogbetad = self.expElogbeta[:, ids]</code>
, called by <code>gamma, sstats = self.inference(chunk, collect_sstats=True)</code>, itself called by <code>gammat = self.do_estep(chunk, other)</code>, itself called by <code>lda_gensim.update(corpus)</code>.</p>

<p>Is anyone having an idea on how to fix this, or what is happening ?</p>

If the results are different every time I run the model, does it mean that the amount of the topics is not correct? What is the best way to evaluate the results?</p>

<p>Take Amazon product as example, where I could access all ""word"" information about one product:</p>

<pre><code>Product_Name    Description      ReviewText
""XXX brand""    ""Pain relief""    ""This is super effective""
</code></pre>

<p>By applying <code>nltk</code> and <code>gensim</code> packages I could easily compare similarity of different products and make recommendations.</p>

<p>But here's another question I feel very vague about:
How to build a search engine for such products? </p>

<p>For example, if I feel pain and would like to search for medicine online, I'd like to type-in <code>""pain relief""</code> or <code>""pain""</code>, whose searching results should include <code>""XXX brand""</code>.</p>

<p>So this sounds more like keyword extraction/tagging question? How should this be done in NLP? I know <strong>corpus</strong> should contain <strong>all</strong> but <strong>single</strong> words, so it's like:</p>

<pre><code>[""XXX brand"" : (""pain"", 1),(""relief"", 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>So if I typed in either <code>""pain""</code> or <code>""relief""</code> I could get <code>""XXX brand""</code>; but what about I searched <code>""pain relief""</code>?</p>

<p>I could come up with idea that directly call python in my javascript for calculate similarities of input words <code>""pain relief""</code> on browser-based server and make recommendation; but that's kind of do-able? </p>

<p>I still prefer to build up very big lists of keywords at backends, stored in datasets/database and directly visualized in web page of search engine.</p>

Additionally, I created another file with stop words, that are not so common, but in my opinion are definitely useless and have no predictive power - let say my dataset is created from chats form helpdesk - words like 'man', 'woman', 'last', 'monday' are not neccessary, but were not included in basic 'stop-words file'. I did it also for reducing a dictionaery - it contains (together with bigrams) around 1800 words now.</p>
<p>The problem I face, is that each time I run the LDA model I get different topics - I use pyLDAvis to visualization - each time I have a feeling that key words for topic are different, so are 'distances' between topics. In other words I would not say, that the model has any reproducibility in its predictions. What I have tried already:</p>
<ul>
<li>checked coherence measure to choose the optimal number of topics</li>
<li>tried many values for random_state parameter</li>
<li>set 'iterations' parameter much higher than in default (to allow the model get the 'true' convergence each time)</li>
<li>tried to run the model on bigger and smaller datasets</li>
<li>tried to run the model on random subsamples of the dataset (let say 5k sample from 50k records) few times to check if result are stable</li>
</ul>
<p>Because results still seems to be unsatisfied, I added and added another words to my 'stop-words file' to reduce the dictionary again, and was hoping it'll make the model more reproducible. Anyway, while there is around 700 houndreds words treating as stop words, I still cannot say the model works as I expected.</p>
<p>What can I do more? Is there any possibility that the dataset is 'too bad' to be used (it's a real data set)?
Maybe making my own 'stop words file' was a mistake? Regarding the second question, I was also trying to remove only the common stop words like 'we, I, you, me' etc. and then do the Tf-Idf, which should do this task for me. But then, I read, that it's usually better to use the 'bag of words set' as the input for the LDA model, not the Tf-Idf representation - indeed, during tests, Tf-Idf representation of data set caused even worse results.</p>

<p>Now what I did see is that I can <code>model.load(SOME_MODEL)</code> and then continue training, but it requires a gensim modle as input. Also <code>reset_from()</code> seems to only accept other gensim model.
But in my case, I don't have a gensim model to start from, but a text file in word2vec format of embeddings.</p>

<pre><code>LabeledSentence(['what', 'happens', 'when', 'an', 'army', 'of', 'wetbacks', 'towelheads', 'and', 'godless', 'eastern', 'european', 'commies', 'gather', 'their', 'forces', 'south', 'of', 'the', 'border', 'gary', 'busey', 'kicks', 'their', 'butts', 'of', 'course', 'another', 'laughable', 'example', 'of', 'reagan-era', 'cultural', 'fallout', 'bulletproof', 'wastes', 'a', 'decent', 'supporting', 'cast', 'headed', 'by', 'l', 'q', 'jones', 'and', 'thalmus', 'rasulala'], ['LABELED_10', '0'])`
</code></pre>

<p>note that this particular document has two tags, namely 'LABELED_10' and  '0'.</p>

<p>Now after i load my model and perform </p>

<pre><code>print(model.docvecs.most_similar(""LABELED_10""))
</code></pre>

<p>i get </p>

<pre><code>[('LABELED_107', 0.48432376980781555), ('LABELED_110', 0.4827481508255005), ('LABELED_214', 0.48039984703063965), ('LABELED_207', 0.479473352432251), ('LABELED_315', 0.47931796312332153), ('LABELED_307', 0.47898322343826294), ('LABELED_124', 0.4776897132396698), ('LABELED_222', 0.4768940210342407), ('LABELED_413', 0.47479286789894104), ('LABELED_735', 0.47462597489356995)]
</code></pre>

<p>which is perfect ! as i get all the tags most similar to LABELED_10. </p>

<p>Now i would like to have a feedback loop while training my model. So if i give my model a new document, i would like to know how good or bad the model's classification is before tagging and adding that document to my corpus. How would i do that using Doc2Vec? So how do i know whether the documents for LABELED_107 and LABELED_10 are actually similar or not. Here is one approach that i have in mind. Here is the code for my random forest classifier</p>

<pre><code>result = cfun.rfClassifer(n_estimators, trainingDataFV, train[""sentiment""],testDataFV)
</code></pre>

<p>and here is the function</p>

<pre><code>def rfClassifer(n_estimators, trainingSet, label, testSet):

    logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)

    forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators)
    forest = forest.fit(trainingSet, label)
    result = forest.predict(testSet)

    return result
</code></pre>

<p>and finally i can do</p>

<pre><code>output = pd.DataFrame(data={""id"": test[""id""], ""sentiment"": result})

output.to_csv(""../../submits/Doc2Vec_AvgVecPredict.csv"", index=False, quoting=3)
</code></pre>

<p>Feedback process</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep a validation set which is tagged correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Feed the tagged validation set to the classifier after removing the tags and save the result in a csv.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the result with another csv that has the correct tags.</p></li>
<li><p>For every mismatch, add those documents to the labeled training set and train the model again.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat for more validation sets.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is this approach correct? Also, can i incrementally train the doc2vec model? Lets say that initially i trained my doc2vec model with 100k tagged docs. Now after the validation step, i need my model to be trained on a further 10k documents. Will i have to train my model from the very beginning ? Meaning will i need to train my model on the initial 100k tagged docs again?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate your insights.</p>

<li>What's the purpose of <code>def __init__(self, dm=1, size=1, window=1):</code>? Can I possibly remove this part, somehow (tried unsuccessfully)?</li>
<li>How can I add a <code>RandomForest</code> classifier (or others) to the GridSearch workflow/pipeline?</li>
<li>How could a train/test data split added to the code above, as the current script only trains on the full dataset?</li>

<p>I know that word2vec needs a lot of space, but I still think there is a problem here. As you see the estimated memory for this model is of 600MB, while my computer has 16GB of RAM. Yet monitoring the process while the code runs shows that it occupies all of my memory and then gets killed.</p>

<p>As other posts advise I have tried to increase min_count and decrease size. But even with ridiculous values (min_count=50, size=10) the process stops at 60%.</p>

<p>I also tried to make python an exception to OOM so that the process doesn't get killed. When I do that, I have a MemoryError instead of the killing.</p>

<p>What is going on ?</p>

<p>(I use a recent laptop with Ubuntu 17.04, 16GB RAM and a Nvidia GTX 960M. I run python 3.6 from Anaconda and gensim 3.0, but it does'nt do better with gensim 2.3)</p>

After training, the word2vec model holds two vectors for each word in the vocabulary: the word embedding (rows of input/hidden matrix) and the context embedding (columns of hidden/output matrix).</p>

<p>As outlined in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36731784/wordvectors-how-to-concatenate-word-vectors-to-form-sentence-vector"">this post</a> there are at least three common ways to combine these two embedding vectors:</p>

<p>However, I couldn't find proper papers or reports on the best strategy. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a common solution whether to sum, average or concatenate the vectors?</li>
<li>Or does the best way depend entirely on the task in question? If so, what strategy is best for a word-level language model?</li>

<p>but in the initial list of tagged document each document has its own unique label.</p>

<p>The code for model training is the following:
</p>

<pre><code>model = Doc2Vec(size=300, sample=1e-4, workers=2)
print('Building Vocabulary')
model.build_vocab(data)
print('Training...')
model.train(data, total_words=total_words_count, epochs=20)

<p>Therefore I can't index my documents like <code>model.docvecs['label_17']</code> and get <code>KeyError</code>.</p>

<p>The same thing if I pass data to the constructor instead of building the vocabulary.</p>

<p>Why is this happening? Thanks.</p>

Unlike most tutorials and code I've seen on gensim my data is not raw, but has already been preprocessed. I have a dictionary in a text document containing 65k words (incl. an ""unknown"" token and a EOL token) and the tweets are saved as a numpy matrix with indices into this dictionary. A simple example of the data format can be seen below:</p>

 [0, 1, 3, 6, 6]]

<p>I'm unsure how I should handle the indices representation. An easy way is just to convert the list of indices to a list of strings (i.e. [0, 1, 2, 3, 6] -> ['0', '1', '2', '3', '6']) as I read it into the word2vec model. However, this must be inefficient as gensim then will try to look up the internal index used for e.g. '2'.</p>

Gensim's FastText, as far as I know, doesn't have an option to create document vectors (better known as Paragraph Vectors [PV]). Therefore I have calculated them manually by taking the average of the sum of the words available in a document. This task alone doesn't take as much time.</p>

<p>If I want to append several other numerical features to the calculated PV, 5 millionen docs take about 30 minutes to create. I thought this process could be improved by splitting the work onto several cores on my computer with the multiprocessing library of Python, which works right now but only to a certain extent.</p>

<p>There were a few problems I had to solve before getting to this stage. Since I am using the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code I had to place some methods in a seperate Python script to be able to use mulitprocessing in a Jupyter Notebook. This is the code that's available in the Jupyter Notebook. It imports the module ""m_helpers"" which has the methods to
create the document vectors:</p>

<pre><code>import multiprocessing
import m_helpers

# Define number of workers.
num_processes = 3

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    # This pool spawns several processes to built the
    # document vectors with the FastText model
    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes = num_processes, 
                              initializer = m_helpers.init_vars, 
                              initargs = (fasttext_model, vars_df)) as pool:
        results = pool.map(m_helpers.create_docvecs,
                           data_df.itertuples(name = False), 
                           chunksize = 512)
        output = [x for x in results]

    # Print length of output to see whether everything was processed
    print(""Length of output (document vectors): {0}"".format(len(output)))
</code></pre>

<p>m_helpers.py:</p>

<pre><code>fasttext_model = None
vars_df = None

def init_vars(model, df):
    global fasttext_model
    fasttext_model = model
    global vars_df
    vars_df = df

def create_docvecs(data):
    word_vectors = [fasttext_model.wv[word] for word in data[-1].str.split()]
    document_vector = sum(word_vectors) / len(word_vectors)
    feature_vector = vars_df.loc[data[0], :].values
    # Further code to combine both vectors
    return document_vector
</code></pre>

<p>I have a computer with 6 cores / 12 threads. However I can make this code work only for 3 cores. Using more cores always results in an error caused by using up all the memory (RAM). I think this is caused by all those copies of objects for each process. </p>

<p>Now there seems to be ways to create a shared memory for all processes to access. There is a dataframe I am iterating over to access the text data. The method that is called for all processes uses an other dataframe and the fasttext model. All of those objects are read only to create the PV and append values from the other dataframe. I could merge the text dataframe and feature dataframe before. However, I would still need to share at least the fasttext_model object. So the question would be, how to do it? Is it possible at all? I have read several questions regarding this problem on stackoverflow but I couldn't make much out of it. Maybe I need to use something different than Pool?</p>

<p>In our system, new document is uploaded every minute and mostly about the same topic (where there are more chance of duplication).</p>

<p>Our current implementation includes gensim doc2vec model trained on documents (tagged with unique document ids). We infer vector for new document and find most_similar docs (ids) with it. Reason behind choosing doc2vec model is that we wanted to take advantage of semantics to improve results. As far as we know, it does not support online training, so we might have to schedule a cron or something that periodically updates the model. But scheduling cron will be disadvantageous as documents come in a burst. User may upload duplicates while model is not yet trained for new data. Also given huge amount of data, training time will be higher.</p>

<p>So i would like to know how such cases are handled in big companies. Are there any better alternative? or better algorithm for such problem?</p>

<p>The dataframe is so big that I am looking for some faster way to iterate over both label columns. So far I tried this:</p>
<pre><code>list_distances = []
temp = []

def preprocess(sentence):
    return [w for w in sentence.lower().split()]

entity = df1['source_label']
target = df2['target_label']

 for i in tqdm(entity):
    for j in target:
        wmd_distance = model.wmdistance(preprocess(i), preprocess(j))
        temp.append(wmd_distance)
    list_distances.append(min(temp))
# print(&quot;list_distances&quot;, list_distances)
WMD_Dataframe = pd.DataFrame({'source_label': pd.Series(entity),
                              'target_label': pd.Series(target),
                              'source_uri': df1['source_uri'],
                              'target_uri': df2['target_uri'],
                              'wmd_Score': pd.Series(list_distances)}).sort_values(by=['wmd_Score'])
WMD_Dataframe = WMD_Dataframe.reset_index()

<p>First of all this code is not working well as the other two columns are coming directly from the dfs' and do not take entities relation with the uri into consideration.
How one can make it faster as the entities are in millions. Thanks in advance.</p>

        word_space.append(sentence)

<p>Everything works just as it is supposed to. The dtype returned by both stemmers is list of strings, so that cannot be the problem. Any ideas why this happens? Thanks!</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>data</code> is a pandas dataframe of text documents (one document per row).</p>

<p>I use the output from <code>train_tfidf</code> above, as input into <code>TfidfRecommendations</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class TfidfRecommendations:

    def __init__(self, data, tfidf_dictionary, tfidf_model, tfidf_index):

        sims = self.tfidf_index[self.tfidf_model[vec_bow]]

<p>the problem with the class <code>TfidfRecommendations</code> is that it returns a list of tuples for <code>sims</code> which is incorrect:</p>

<pre><code>tfidf_model, tfidf_dictionary, tfidf_index = train_tfidf(data)
TFIDF = TfidfRecommendations(data, tfidf_dictionary, tfidf_model, tfidf_index)

"40458742","1","40566701","","2016-11-07 06:03:00","","17","4659","<p>In the word2vec model, there are two linear transforms that take a word in vocab space to a hidden layer (the ""in"" vector), and then back to the vocab space (the ""out"" vector). Usually this out vector is discarded after training. I'm wondering if there's an easy way of accessing the out vector in gensim python? Equivalently, how can I access the out matrix?</p>

<p>Motivation: I would like to implement the ideas presented in this recent paper: <a href=""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01137v1.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Dual Embedding Space Model for Document Ranking</a></p>

<p>Here are more details. From the reference above we have the following word2vec model:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpupG.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OpupG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Here, the input layer is of size $V$, the vocabulary size, the hidden layer is of size $d$, and an output layer of size $V$. The two matrices are W_{IN} and W_{OUT}. <em>Usually</em>, the word2vec model keeps only the W_IN matrix. This is what is returned where, after training a word2vec model in gensim, you get stuff like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>model['potato']=[-0.2,0.5,2,...] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I access, or retain W_{OUT}? This is likely quite computationally expensive, and I'm really hoping for some built in methods in gensim to do this because I'm afraid that if I code this from scratch, it would not give good performance.</p>

Recently, I was looking at initializing my model weights with some pre-trained word2vec model such as (GoogleNewDataset pretrained model). I have been struggling with it couple of weeks. Now, I just searched out that in gesim there is a function that can help me to initialize the weights of my model with pre-trained model weights. That is mentioned below:</p>

<pre><code>reset_from(other_model)

    Borrow shareable pre-built structures (like vocab) from the other_model. Useful if testing multiple models in parallel on the same corpus.

<ol>
<li>TF-IDF for all terms in a collection of document with sklearn.</li>
<li>Given the document-term-matrix of above, I removed all words that do not satisfy a tf-idf threshold (i.e. tf-idf: 0.1)</li>
<li>Converted the dtm in Compressed Sparse Row matrix</li>
<li>Create a corpus [with gensim.corpora.Dictionary.fromcorpus()] from the csr matrix</li>

<p>Unfortunately, the dictionary created on 1) contains all the words from the original non-filtered documents.</p>
<p>How to filter the vocabulary according to the new filtered dtm and keep the indexes consistent? Please note that I have already managed to create a customized dictionary only including relevant words to give to gensim.Lda_MultiCore(), but I cannot use the feature compactify() because it doesn't work on customized dictionary</p>

My data is an stream of text data (such as tweets) continuously coming in time. For clustering these tweets, I was thinking of using doc2vec to reduce the text content into a fixed size vector and use that to compare between documents. 
So in this case, the text data is getting accumulated over time, can this be still used with Doc2Vec, I may have to learn the model again and again (may be!) or could I use some large corpus such as Wikipedia or a large newscorpus to train the Doc2Vec model.</p>

<p>From the Gensim documentation, <code>size</code> is the dimensionality of the vector.

So, suppose if my <code>vocab</code> size is 30 then how does it create a vector with the dimension greater than 30?

However, if I put > 1 workers, then it dies (unexpectedly with exit code -11) in a stage with 2 dependencies. The code is rather complex, so a minimum example would be difficult to give. The gist of the matter is that I am doing the following things with <code>gensim</code>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Building a dictionary from some texts.</li>
<li>Building a corpus from said texts and the dictionary (requires (1)).</li>
<li>Training an LDA model from the corpus and dictionary (requires (1) and (2)).</li>
</ol>

<p>For some reason, step (3) crashes every time I put more than one worker, even if (1) and (2) are already completed...</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Here is an example of the logging info. TrainLDA is task (3). There are still two tasks after that that require TrainLDA. All earlier tasks finished correctly. I substituted TrainLDA's arguments for <code>...</code> so that the output would be more readable. The additional info are just <code>print</code> statements we put to help us know what is happening.</p>

<pre><code>dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(data)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in data]
num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()
num_topics = 150
lda = LdaMulticore(corpus=corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary, workers=num_cores, alpha=1e-4, eta=5e-1,
              minimum_probability=0.0)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to extract a distribution matrix of size N * M where N is the number of documents in the corpus, and M is the number of topics. Each row therefore would represent a document, and each column would represent a topic. These distributions are already available in the <code>lda</code> model variable e.g.</p>

<pre><code>lda
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[(0,0.01),(1,0.23),(2,1e-7)],
    [(0,0.91),(1,0.067),(2,0.38)]]
</code></pre>

<p>where the above represents a simple example if we had 2 documents and 3 topics (0,1,2). So <code>lda</code> is a list of list of tuples, where each list is a document, the first element in the tuple is the topic id and the second element is the topic contribution to that document.</p>

<p>What I have done so far</p>

<pre><code># approach 1
distributions = np.array( [[tup[1] for tup in lst] for lst in lda[corpus]] )
# approach 2 (about 3X slower than approach 1)
distributions = np.array(lda[corpus])[:,:,1]
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is, for a dataset with 300k documents and 150 topics, creating the <code>distributions</code> matrix using approach 1 takes over 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I want to create this matrix to feed into a function which calculates document similarity (comparing the first row / document of the matrix to all other rows / documents). If there is a way to directly feed the learned <code>lda</code> model values into the function, that would be great as it would save time on creating the redundant matrix. If not, is there a more efficient way to create the <code>distributions</code> matrix?</p>

<p>For reference, the document comparison function into which the <code>distributions</code> matrix is fed is</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
from scipy.stats import entropy
def jsd(mat):
    mat = normalize(mat, axis=1, norm='l1')
    p = mat[0,None].T # just comparing first row to all other rows
    q = mat[0:].T
    m = 0.5*(p + q)
    return 0.5*(entropy(p,m) + entropy(q,m))

Corpus is created from a list of lemmatized tokens <code>doc.tokens</code></p>

<pre><code>bowlist = []
for doc in linked_doc_list:
    bowlist.append(doc.tokens)

dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(bowlist)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(line) for line in bowlist]

<p>This involves transforming the Gensim corpus to a numpy array like so:</p>

<pre><code> numpy_matrix = gensim.matutils.corpus2dense(package.corpus, num_terms=len(package.dict.token2id))
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to work. The sklearn lda runs:</p>

<pre><code>model = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=components,
                                          max_iter=maxiter,

</code></pre>

<p>But now, to read the results, I need to read the actual terms from the gensim dict (otherwise I am stuck with meaningless feature numbers).</p>

<p>However, the results from the following code are clearly meaningless. </p>

<pre><code> def filterAndReportResultsLDA(self, model, gensimdict, n_top_words=10):
     for topic_idx, topic in enumerate(model.components_):
         print(""Topic %d:"" % (topic_idx))
         words = []
         for i in topic.argsort()[:-n_top_words - 1:-1]:
            words.append(gensimdict[i])
         print(words)

<p>Example result is:</p>

<p>I have a hypothesis for why this is happening. I believe that the alphas for the probability of a topic given a document would also need to be set, otherwise, if the probability for a seeded topic is very low, the seedwords may not matter much at all. </p>

In my application, I am tagging multiple documents with same label (topic), I am training a doc2vec model on my corpus using dbow_words=1 in order to train word vectors as well. I have been able to obtain similarities between word and document vectors in this fashion which does make a lot of sense
For ex. getting documents labels similar to a word-
doc2vec_model.docvecs.most_similar(positive = [doc2vec_model[""management""]], topn = 50))</p>

<p>My question however is about theoretical interpretation of computing similarity between word2vec and doc2vec  vectors. Would it be safe to assume that when trained on the same corpus with same dimensionality (d = 200), word vectors and document vectors can always be compared to find similar words for a document label or similar document labels for a word. Any suggestion/ideas are most welcome.</p>

<p>Question 2: My other questions is about impact of high/low frequency of a word in final word2vec model. If wordA and wordB have similar contexts in a particular doc label(set) of documents but wordA has much higher frequency than wordB, would wordB have higher similarity score with the corresponding doc label or not. I am trying to train multiple word2vec models by sampling corpus in a temporal fashion and want to know if the hypothesis that as words get more and more frequent, assuming context relatively stays similar, similarity score with a document label would also increase. Am I wrong to make this assumption? Any suggestions/ideas are very welcome.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Manish</p>

Note: the answer of the question ""Getting TF-IDF Scores Of Words Using Gensim"" doesn't really solves the problem; it gives an unique value for each word</p>

<pre><code>class Corpus(object):
    """"""Iterator for feeding sentences to word2vec""""""
    def __init__(self, dirname):
        self.dirname = dirname

    def __iter__(self):

        text = ''

        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(self.dirname):

            for file in files:

                if file.endswith("".txt""):

                    file_path = os.path.join(root, file)


                    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:

                         text = f.read().decode('utf-8')
                         sentences = sent_tokenizer.tokenize(text)

                         for sent in sentences:
                             yield word_tokenizer.tokenize(sent)
</code></pre>

<p>Here I use the punkt tokenizer (which uses an unsupervised algorithm for detecting sentence boundaries) in the nltk package for splitting the text into sentences. However, when I replace this with just a simple <code>line.split()</code> i.e just considering each sentence as one line and splitting the words, I get a time efficiency that is 1.5 times faster than using the nltk parser. The code inside the 'with open' looks something like this: </p>

<pre><code>                 with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                    for line in f:
                    line.decode('utf-8')
                    yield line.split()
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how important is it for the word2vec algorithm to be fed sentences that are actual sentences (something that I attempt to do with punkt tokenizer)? Is it sufficient for each word in the algorithm to receive a context of the surrounding words that lie on one line  (these words may not necessarily be an actual sentence in the case of a sentence spanning several lines) as opposed to the context of words that the word may have in a sentence spanning several lines. Also, what sort of a part does window size play in this. When a window size is set to 5 for example, does the size of sentences yielded by the Sentences iterator ceases to play a part? Will only window size decide the context words then? In that case should I just use <code>line.split()</code> instead of trying to detect actual sentence boundaries using the punkt tokenizer? </p>

<p>I hope I have been able to describe the issue sufficiently, I would really appreciate any opinions or pointers or help regarding this.</p>

<p><code>word -0.0762464299711 0.0128308048976 ... 0.0712385589283\n’</code></p>

<p>on each line for every word (with 297 extra floats in place of the <code>...</code>). I am trying to load these with Gensim as KeyedVectors, because I ultimately would like to compute the cosine similarity, find most similar words, etc. Unfortunately I have not worked with Gensim before and from the documentation it's not quite clear to me how to do this. I have tried the following which I found <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<p><code>word_vectors = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('/embeddings/word.vectors', binary=False)</code></p>

<p>However this gives the following error:</p>

<p><code>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'the'</code></p>

<p>'the' is the first word in the text file, so I suspect that the loading function is expecting something to be there that is not. But I can't find any information on what should be there. I would highly appreciate a pointer to such information or any other solution to my problem. Thanks!</p>

<p>I would like to compute the cosine similarity between the two lists above in such a way where the cosine similarity between the first sub-list in list1 and all sublists of list 2 are measured against each other. Then the same thing but with the second sub-list in list 1 and all sub-lists in list 2, etc.</p>

<p>The goal is to create a <strong>len(list_2) by len(list_1) matrix</strong>, and each entry in that matrix is a cosine similarity score. Currently I've done this the following way:</p>

<pre><code>import gensim
import numpy as np
from gensim.models import KeyedVectors

model = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('./data/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz', binary=True)

    for j, L1 in enumerate(list_1):
        similarity_mat[i, j] = model.n_similarity(L2, L1)
</code></pre>

<p>However, I'd like to implement this with matrix multiplication and no for loops. </p>

<p>My two questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a way to do some sort of element-wise matrix multiplication but with <code>gensim's n_similiarity() method</code> to generate the required matrix?</li>
<li>Would it be more efficient and faster using the current method or matrix multiplication?</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope my question was clear enough, please let me know if I can clarify even further.</p>

<p>Is it possible to load previously trained model and update weights of embeddings (maybe adding new word embeddings to my model)? Or do I need to  28 (26+2) million tweets from beginning? It takes 5 hours with current parameters and will take longer with a bigger data.</p>

<p>One other question, is it possible to retrieve sentences parameter directly from database (instead of reading it from <em>txt</em>, <em>bz2</em> or <em>gz</em> files)? As our data to be trained is getting bigger, it would be better to bypassing text read/write operations.</p>

So I am wondering if I can train a Phrases model per document and then find a way to merge them after.</p>

<p>But if I give a subquery like <code>&quot;to the beach&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;what to do&quot;</code>, it returns an error message because the sub-phrase is not in the vocabulary.</p>

<p>How can I solve this issue without training again the model?
How can the model identify the most similar phrases based on a new phrase, not necessary a subphrase?</p>

<pre><code>for word,embd in missing_embd.items():
    # model.wv.build_vocab(word,update=True)
    model.wv.syn0[model.wv.vocab[word].index]=embd

<p>There is an un-consistency. When I print missing_embed, it's empty. As if there were not any missing words.
But when I check it by this:</p>

1- why <strong><em>missing_embed</em></strong> is empty while there are some missing words?
2- Is it possible that GoogleNews doesn't have words like ""to""?
3- how can I append new embeddings to word2vec model? I used <strong><em>build_vocab</em></strong> and <strong><em>syn0</em></strong>. Thanks.</p>

Now, my txt-files are a bit messy and I need to remove all ´<code>\n</code>´ newlines, read all sentences from my loaded string (txt-file) and then tokenize each sentence for using the word2vec model.</p>

<p>The thing is: I cant read the files line-by-line, cause some sentences do not end after one line. Therefore, I use ´<code>nltk.tokenizer.tokenize()</code>´, which splits the file into sentences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cant figure out, how to convert a list of strings into a list of list, where each sub-list contains the sentences, while passing it thourgh a generator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or do I actually need to save each sentences into a new file (one sentence per line) to pass it through a generator?</p>

<p>Well, my code looks like this:
´<code>tokenizer = nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')</code></p>

<pre><code># initialize tokenizer for processing sentences

class Raw_Sentences(object):
    def __init__(self, dirname):
        self.dirname = dirname

    def __iter__(self):
        for file in file_loads: ## Note: file_loads includes directory name of files (e.g. 'C:/Users/text-file1.txt')
            with open(file,'r', encoding='utf-8') as t:     
               # print(tokenizer.tokenize(t.read().replace('\n', ' ')))           
                storage = tokenizer.tokenize(t.read().replace('\n', ' '))
# I tried to temporary store the list of sentences to a list for an iteration
                for sentence in storage:
                    print(nltk.word_tokenize(sentence))
                    yield nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)´
</code></pre>

<p>So the goal is: 
load file 1: ´<code>'some messy text here. And another sentence'</code>´
 tokenize into sentences ´<code>['some messy text here','And another sentence']</code>´
and then split each sentence into words ´<code>[['some','messy','text','here'],['And','another','sentence']]</code>´</p>

<p>load file 2: <code>'some other messy text. sentence1. sentence2.'</code>
etc.</p>

<p>and input sentences into word2vec model:
´<code>sentences = Raw_Sentences(directory)</code>´</p>

<p>´<code>model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences)</code>´</p>

<p>Unlike words, the items in my corpus have their lifetime and there will be new items added in everyday. In order to prevent the constant growth of the model size, I need to drop items that reached their lifetime while keep the model trainable. I've read the similar question
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48941648/how-to-remove-a-word-completely-from-a-word2vec-model-in-gensim"">here</a>, but this question's answer doesn't related to increased-training and is based on <code>KeyedVectors</code>. I come up with the below code, but I'm not sure if it is correct and proper:</p>
<pre><code>from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np

texts = [[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;], [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]]

# drop old words

for w in wordsToDrop:
    i = m.wv.index2word.index(w)
    m.wv.index2word.pop(i)
    m.wv.vectors = np.delete(m.wv.vectors, i, axis=0)
    del m.wv.vocab[w]

print(m.wv.index2word)
print(m.wv.vectors)
m.save(&quot;m.model&quot;)

m.build_vocab(new, update=True)
m.train(new, total_examples=m.corpus_count, epochs=2)
print(m.wv.index2word)
print(m.wv.vectors)
</code></pre>
<p>After deleting and increased training, is the <code>m.wv.index2word</code> and <code>m.wv.vectors</code> still element-wise corresponding? Is there any side-effect of above code? If my way is not good, could someone give me an example to show how to drop the old &quot;words&quot; properly and keep the model trainable?</p>

<p>Now I want to find the highest matching features for each of the added documents. To find the best features in a particular document, I am running gensim's similarity module for each of the features on all the documents. This gives us a score for each of the feature that we want to use later on. But as you can imagine, this is a costly process as we have to iterate over 50000 indices and run 4000 iterations of similarity on each. </p>

<p>I need a better way of doing this as I run out of 8 GB memory on my system at around 1000 iterations. There's actually no reason for the memory to keep rising as I am only reallocating it during the iterations. Surprisingly the memory starts rising only after around 200 iterations. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why the memory issue? How can it be solved?</li>
<li>Is there a better way of finding the highest scored features in a particular document (not topics)?</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a snippet of the code that runs out of memory:</p>

<pre><code>dictionary = corpora.Dictionary.load('features-dict.dict')
corpus = corpora.MmCorpus('corpus.mm')
lsi = models.LsiModel.load('model.lsi')
corpus_lsi = lsi[corpus]
index = similarities.MatrixSimilarity(list(corpus_lsi))
newDict = dict()

for feature in dictionary.token2id.keys():
  vec_bow = dictionary.doc2bow([feature])
  vec_lsi = lsi[vec_bow]
  sims = index[vec_lsi]
  li = sorted(enumerate(sims * 100), key=lambda item: -item[1])

  for data in li:
    dict[data[0]] = (feature,data[1]) # Store feature and score for each document


# Do something with the dict created above
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>The memory issue was resolved using a memory profiler. There was something else in that loop that caused it to rise drastically.</p>

<p>Let me explain the purpose in detail. Imagine we are dealing with various recipes (each recipe is document) and each item in our dictionary is an ingredient. Find six such recipes below.</p>

<p><code>corpus = [[Olive Oil, Tomato, Brocolli, Oregano], [Garlic, Olive Oil, Bread, Cheese, Oregano], [Avocado, Beans, Cheese, Lime], [Jalepeneo, Lime, Tomato, Tortilla, Sour Cream], [Chili Sauce, Vinegar, Mushrooms, Rice], [Soy Sauce, Noodles, Brocolli, Ginger, Vinegar]]</code></p>

<p>There are thousands of such recipes. What I am trying to achieve is to assign a weight between 0 and 100 to each of the ingredient (where higher weighted ingredient is the most important or most unique). What would be the best way to achieve this.</p>

<li><p>I create an embedding layer and set the trainable true, so not only I have an embedding, but also, that embedding will be trained based on my task</p></li>
<li><p>I create an Embedding layer, load already trained weights, and set trainable False. in this case, the weights will not get updated.</p></li>

I tried installing these into my Python 2.7 on a Windows 7 environment but came across several errors due to some issues with ""numpy"" and ""scipy"" installations on Windows 7. Then I ended up resolving those errors by uninstalling Python 2.7 and instead installing Anaconda Python which successfully installed the required ""gensim"" and ""nltk"" libraries. </p>

<p>So, at this stage I am able to see all these ""gensim"" and ""nltk"" libraries resolving properly without any error in ""Spyder"" and ""PyCharm"". However, when I run my application in Web2Py, it still complains about ""gensim"" and gives this error: <code>&lt;type 'exceptions.ImportError'&gt; No module named gensim</code></p>

<p>My guess is if I can configure Web2Py to use the Anaconda Python then this issue would be resolved. </p>

<p>I need to know if it's possible to configure Web2Py to use Anaconda Python and if it is then how do I do that? </p>

<p>Otherwise, if someone knows of some other way resolve that ""gensim"" error in Web2Py kindly share your thoughts.</p>

<p>All your help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>With my virtual env setup, I then added numpy, scipy, and gensim:
- pip install -U --force numpy

<p>Does anyone know why might this happen? I think it has to do with D2VTransformer because when I'm running the code below I'm getting the same error:</p>

<pre><code>model = D2VTransformer(min_count=1, size=5)
docvecs = model.fit_transform(X_train) 
</code></pre>

<p>But when trying to select only one column from the dataframe:</p>

<pre><code>docvecs = model.fit_transform(X_train['name']) 
</code></pre>

<p>it doesn't throw an error and that is why when I created the pipelines I've only used one column, but still getting the error.</p>

For example, the constructor of Doc2Vec has a parameter <em>iter</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iter (int) – Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.</p>

<p>Why does the train method then also have a similar parameter called <em>epochs</em>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>epochs (int) – Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the difference between both? There's one more paragraph on it in the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To avoid common mistakes around the model’s ability to do multiple
  training passes itself, an explicit epochs argument MUST be provided.
  In the common and recommended case, where train() is only called once,
  the model’s cached iter value should be supplied as epochs value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I do not really understand why the constructor needs a <em>iter</em> parameter and what exactly should be provided for it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>I just saw that there is also the possibility to specify the corpus directly in the constructor rather than calling train() separately. So I think in this case, <em>iter</em> would be used and otherwise <em>epochs</em>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>If so, what is the difference between specifying the corpus in the constructor and calling train() manually? Why would one choose the one or other?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:</p>

<p>Although not mentioned in the docs, <em>iter</em> is now depreciated as parameter of Doc2Vec. It was renamed to <em>epochs</em> to be consistent with the parameter of <em>train()</em>. Training seems to work with that, although I struggle with <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50390455/gensim-doc2vec-memoryerror-when-training-on-english-wikipedia"">MemoryErrors</a>.</p>

<p>I notice that the output is extremely case-sensitive. For example,</p>

<pre><code>string1=model.infer_vector(""machine Learning"".split())
string2=model.infer_vector(""computer Science"".split())
spatial.distance.cosine(string1, string2)

<p>I think that I should lower case everything before train the model. However, as shown in the link above, I first read the input directly:</p>

<pre><code>class TaggedWikiDocument(object):

wiki = WikiCorpus(""enwiki-latest-pages-articles-sample2.xml.bz2"")
documents = TaggedWikiDocument(wiki)

<p>Any suggestion on how I can lower all the cases in the wiki document?</p>

<p>By the way, I used a very small file size for now just to test out whether there are errors in running the code, hence it can be the reason that infer_vector is very sensitive to case. Maybe this problem is minimum if I use the actual wiki dataset ?</p>

<pre><code>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the multiarray numpy extension module failed.  Most
likely you are trying to import a failed build of numpy.
Here is how to proceed:
- If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git clean -xdf`
  (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
- If you are simply trying to use the numpy version that you have installed:
  your installation is broken - please reinstall numpy.
- If you have already reinstalled and that did not fix the problem, then:
  1. Check that you are using the Python you expect (you're using /Users/lorajohns/anaconda3/bin/python),
     and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can
     interfere with the Python and numpy versions you're trying to use.
  2. If (1) looks fine, you can open a new issue at
     https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.  Please include details on:
     - how you installed Python
     - how you installed numpy
     - your operating system
     - whether or not you have multiple versions of Python installed
     - if you built from source, your compiler versions and ideally a build log

     Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on
     an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.

<p>Specifically, I'm working with Word2Vec vectors and loading them using gensim's KeyedVectors.</p>

<p>My app is in Python Flask, running on a Linux server, containerized using Docker.</p>

<p>My goal is to reduce processing time by keeping a handful of large vectors files loaded in memory at all times. </p>

<p>I first tried storing them in global variables in Flask, but then <em>each</em> of my 8 gunicorn workers loads the vectors, which eats up a lot of RAM.</p>

<p>I only need <em>one</em> worker to store a particular vectors file.</p>

<p>I've been told that one solution is to have a set number of RQ workers holding the vectors in a global variable, so that I can control which workers get which vectors files loaded in.</p>

<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>

<p><em>RQ_worker.py</em></p>

<pre><code>from rq import Worker, Connection
from gensim.models.keyedvectors import KeyedVectors
from my_common_methods import get_redis

W2V = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('some_path/vectors.bin', binary=True)

def rq_task(some_args):
    # use some_args and W2V to do some processing, e.g.:
    with open(some_args_filename, 'w') as f_out:
        f_out.write(str(W2V['word']))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Connection(get_redis()):
        worker = Worker(['default'])
        worker.work()
</code></pre>

<p><em>app.py</em></p>

<pre><code>from rq import Queue, Connection
from RQ_worker import rq_task

@app.route(""/someroute"", methods=['POST'])
def some_route():
    # test Redis Queue
    with Connection(get_redis()):
        q = Queue()
        task = q.enqueue(rq_task, some_args)
</code></pre>

<p><em>docker-stack.yml</em></p>

<p>(I redacted a bunch of stuff from Docker, but can provide more details, if relevant.)</p>

<p>The above generally works, <strong>except</strong> that the RQ worker seems to load W2V <strong>from scratch</strong> each time it gets a new job, which defeats the whole purpose. It should keep the vectors stored in W2V as a global variable, so they don't need to be reloaded each time.</p>

<p>Am I missing something? Should I set it up differently? </p>

<p>I've been told that it might be possible to use mmap to load the vectors file into a global variable that the RQ worker sits on, but I'm not sure how that would work with KeyedVectors.</p>

<p>Any advice would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>I downloaded a <strong>pre-trained word embedding model</strong> for <strong>Spanish</strong> (over 1 million words 300-dimensional word vectors for Spanish)
I loaded it successfully and I even managed to undertake a couple of experiments, such as most similar words and basic analogies in Spanish (A is to B as C is to what), but when I try the following:</p>

<p>It raises the error:</p>

<p>I already checked that the word is actually in the word embedding. I have also eliminated the possibility of an encoding error. </p>

<p>Based on my research, this type of error is produced when the token/word is supposed to be wrapped in a list [], however I don’t know how to apply that to this specific problem.

To do this, I build a gensim dictionary and then use that dictionary to create bag-of-word representations of the corpus that I use to build the model. </p>

<p>The step to build the dictionary looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>dict = gensim.corpora.Dictionary(tokens)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>token</code> is a list of unigrams and bigrams like this:</p>

<pre><code>[('restore',),
 ('diversification',),
 ('made',),
 ('transport',),
 ('The',),
 ('grass',),
 ('But',),
 ('distinguished', 'newspaper'),
 ('came', 'well'),
 ('produced',),
 ('car',),
 ('decided',),
 ('sudden', 'movement'),
 ('looking', 'glasses'),
 ('shapes', 'replaced'),
 ('beauties',),
 ('put',),
 ('college', 'days'),
 ('January',),
 ('sometimes', 'gives')]
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I provide a list such as this to <code>gensim.corpora.Dictionary()</code>, the algorithm reduces all tokens to bigrams, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>test = gensim.corpora.Dictionary([(('happy', 'dog'))])
[test[id] for id in test]
=&gt; ['dog', 'happy']
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to generate a dictionary with gensim that includes bigrams? </p>

So, basically if the user write ""operating system"" my goal is to expand that term with very similar terms like ""os"", ""windows"", ""ubuntu"", ""software"" and so on.</p>

<p>The model works very well but now the time has come to improve the model with ""external information"", with ""external information"" i mean OOV (out-of-vocabulary) terms OR terms that do not have good context.</p>

<p>Following the example i wrote above when the user writes <strong>operating system</strong> i would like to expand the query with the ""general"" terms:</p>

<p>Terms built in the FastText model:</p>

<ul>
<li>windows </li>
<li>ubuntu</li>
<li>software</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AND</strong> </p>

<p>terms that represent (organizations/companies) like ""Microsoft"", ""Apple"" so the complete query will be:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>term</strong>: operating system</li>
<li><strong>query</strong>: operating system, os, software, windows, ios, Microsoft, Apple</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem is that i DO NOT have companies inside the corpus OR, if present, i do not have to much context to ""link"" Microsoft to ""operating system"".</p>

<p>For example if i extract a piece inside the corpus i can read ""... i have started working at Microsoft in November 2000 with my friend John ..."" so, as you can see, i cannot contextualize ""Microsoft"" word because i do not have good context, indeed.</p>

<p>A small recap:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a corpus where the companies (terms) have poor context</li>
<li>I have a big database with companies and the description of what they do.</li>
</ol>

<p>What i need to do:</p>

<p>I would like to include the companies in my FastText model and set ""manually"" their words context/cloud of related terms.</p>

<p>To put it sraightforwardly... I have no clue why permission is being denied when I try to save my lda model to a particular location. Right now even the original <code>models/</code> directory location is giving me ""permission denied"" with this error message. It's seeming like any and all directories I could use just... won't work. This is odd behavior and I can't really find asks that talk about this error in the same context. I have found posts of people getting this error message when they actually tried storing in locations that did not exist. But for me that isn't really a question.</p>

<p>When I first got this error... I actually started to wonder if it was because I had another lda topic model that I named topic_model_1. It was stored in the <code>models/</code> subdirectory. I started to wonder if the name was a potential cause, and changed it to <code>lda_model_topic_1</code> to see if that could change results... but nothing is working.</p>

<p>Even if you can't really figure out what solution applies to my situation (especially since right now I don't have reproducible code, I just have my work)... Can someone tell me what this error message means? When and why does it come up? Maybe that's a start.</p>

2) special character and numeric value removal.

test = 'nokia pewter black gb gb ram'.split()
new_vector = model.infer_vector(test)
similar = model.docvecs.most_similar([new_vector]) 
print(similar) # It returns index of sentence and similarity score
</code></pre>

<p>for testing i have passed same sentences which are present in training data but model does not give related documents as similar document,for example i got ""<strong>lootmela tempered glass guard for micromax canvas juice</strong>"" as a most similar sentence to <strong>""nokia pewter black gb gb ram""</strong> this sentence with 0.80 as a similarity score.</p>

<pre><code>So my questions to you: 
1) Do i need to reconsider parameters for model training?

The model training works fine with smaller data sets, say 5M-10M records. However, when training on the full dataset, the process dies mostly at the ""resetting layer weights"" stage. Sometimes, it dies before.</p>

<p>I'm suspecting that it's a memory issue. I have 16GB of RAM with 4 cores. If it's indeed a memory issue, is there any way I can train the model in batches. From reading the documentation, it seems train() is useful in cases where the new documents don't have new vocabularies. But, this is not the case with my documents.</p>

I know that it's disabled by default with <code>dbow_words=0</code>. But what happens when we set <code>dbow_words</code> to 1?</p>

<p>In my understanding of DBOW, the context words are predicted directly from the paragraph vectors. So the only parameters of the model are the <code>N</code> <code>p</code>-dimensional paragraph vectors plus the parameters of the classifier.</p>

<p>But multiple sources hint that it is possible in DBOW mode to co-train word and doc vectors. For instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>section 5 of <a href=""https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1609"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An Empirical Evaluation of doc2vec with Practical Insights into Document Embedding Generation</a></li>

</ul>

<p>So, how is this done? <strong>Any clarification would be much appreciated!</strong></p>

<p>Note: for DM, the paragraph vectors are averaged/concatenated with the word vectors to predict the target words. In that case, it's clear that words vectors are trained simultaneously with document vectors. And there are <code>N*p + M*q + classifier</code> parameters (where <code>M</code> is vocab size and <code>q</code> word vector space dim).</p>

<p>I'm not a mathematician, so I'm hoping there's a &quot;dumbed down&quot; solution to this. In short, I'm attempting to compare two bodies of text to generate recommendations. What you'll see below is a novice attempt at measuring similarity using NLP. I'm open to all feedback. But my primary question: does the method described below serve as an accurate means of finding similarities (in wording, sentiment, etc) in two bodies of text? If not, how would you generate such a recommendation engine (new methods, new data, etc)?</p>
<p>I currently have two dictionaries – one with personality data called <strong>personality_feature_dict</strong> that includes the personality type and associated descriptor words: <code>{'Type 1': ['able', 'accepting', 'according', 'accountable'...]}</code> and the other called <strong>book_feature_dict</strong> containing book titles and their own descriptor words, which were extracted using TF-IDF <code>{'Book Title': ['actually', 'administration', 'age', 'allow', 'anti'...]}</code></p>
<p>As it stands, I'm using the following code to calculate the similarity between dictionary values from each to identify % similarity. First, I create a larger corpus using all dictionary items.</p>
<pre><code>book_values = list(book_feature_dict.values())
personality_values = list(personality_feature_dict.values()) 

texts = book_values + personality_values

dictionary = Dictionary(texts)
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Then I create an LDA model to identify similarities. My knowledge of LDA modeling is limited, so if you spot an error here, I appreciate you flagging it!</p>
<pre><code>from gensim.models import ldamodel
model = ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=4, minimum_probability=1e-8)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I iterate through sets of values as bags of words and compare how the first personality type or <code>(personality_feature_dict.values())[personality_num]</code> compares to 99 book descriptions/values by finding the Hellinger distance.</p>
<pre><code>from gensim.matutils import hellinger
personality_num = 0
i = 0

while i &lt; 98:

    s_0 = list(book_feature_dict.values())[i]
    s_0_bow = model.id2word.doc2bow(s_0)
    s_0_lda_bow = model[s_0_bow]

    e_0 = list(personality_feature_dict.values())[personality_num]
    e_0_bow = model.id2word.doc2bow(e_0)
    e_0_lda_bow = model[e_0_bow]

    x = 100 - (hellinger(e_0_lda_bow, s_0_lda_bow)*100)
    i = i+1

</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I print all instances where the LDA model comes back with a high correlation as a percentage.</p>
<pre><code>    if x &gt; 50:
        print (list(personality_feature_dict.keys())[personality_num])
        print('similarity to ', (list(book_feature_dict.keys())[i]), 'is')
        print(x, '%', '\n\n')

</code></pre>
<p>The result looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Personality Type 
similarity to  Name of Book 1 is
84.6029228744518 % 


Personality Type 
similarity to  Name of Book 2 is
83.09513184950528 % 


Personality Type 
similarity to  Name of Book 3 is
85.44322295890642 %

<p>I am using python <code>gensim.models.Word2Vec</code> to train a word embedding model. Based on my understanding, the model training is in essence a machine learning issue---to train a neural network via a prediction task. For example, if I select parameters to train a skip-gram model, then the model is trained by predicting context words from target word. Once the model is well-trained, word vectors are just obtained from the model.</p>

<p>If my understanding is correct, so since in fact it is a machine learning process and the training goal is to perform well in the prediction task, there should be a loss function during training and the model is supposed to make the loss as low as possible. So, how to know the <strong>model loss value</strong> for a given set of parameters? Or is there <strong>any other metrics</strong> that we can know to <strong>understand the model itself</strong>?</p>

<p>Hope I have made my question clear. In a word, I <strong>don't</strong> want to evaluate the model by its outputs as in the Google test set <a href=""http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/questions-words.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://word2vec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/questions-words.txt</a>, but I want to understand the model itself as a simple machine learning problem during its training process.

<p>According to my experience I found that the output vector in <code>gensim.doc2vec</code> for each sentence is dependent on other sentences as well, which means we can not directly use the model to generate vector for newly arriving sentence. Please anyone help me with this. Thanks.</p>

I have trained a Gensim Word2Vec model and it is learning word associations pretty well. However, I couldn’t get my head around how to properly add the layer to a Keras model. (And how to do an ‘inverse embedding’ for the output. But that’s another question that had been answered: by default you can’t.)</p>

<p>In Word2Vec, when you input a string, e.g. <code>model.wv[‘hello’]</code>, you get a vector representation of the word. However, I believe that the <code>keras.layers.Embedding</code> layer returned by Word2Vec's <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html#gensim.models.keyedvectors.Word2VecKeyedVectors.get_keras_embedding"" rel=""noreferrer"">get_keras_embedding()</a> takes a one-hot/tokenized input, instead of a string input. But the documentation provides no explanation on what the appropriate input is. <strong>I cannot figure out how to obtain the one-hot/tokenized vector of the vocabulary that has 1-to-1 correspondence with the Embedding layer’s input.</strong></p>

<p>More elaboration below:</p>

<p>Currently my workaround is to apply the embedding outside Keras before feeding it to the network. Is there any detriment in doing this? I will set the embedding to non-trainable anyway. So far I have noticed that memory use is extremely inefficient (like 50GB even before declaring the Keras model for a collection of 64-word-long sentences) having to load the padded inputs and the weights outside the model. Maybe generator can help.</p>

<p>The following is my code. Inputs are padded to 64-words long. The Word2Vec embedding has 300 dimensions. There are probably a lot of mistakes here due to repeated experimentation trying to make embedding work. Suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>However, I expect that all this processes share same memory for KeyedVector, so it only takes 5.4 GB shared between all containers.</p>

<p>Have someone tried to achieve that and succeed?</p>

<p>edit: 
I tried following code snippet and it indeed share same memory across different containers.</p>

<pre><code>import mmap
from threading import Semaphore

with open(""data/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin"", ""rb"") as f:
    # memory-map the file, size 0 means whole file
    fileno = f.fileno()
    mm = mmap.mmap(fileno, 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)
    # read whole content
    mm.read()
    Semaphore(0).acquire()
    # close the map
    mm.close()
</code></pre>

<p>So the problem that <code>KeyedVectors.load(model_path, mmap='r')</code> don't share memory</p>

<p>edit2:
Studying gensim's source code I see that <code>np.load(subname(fname, attrib), mmap_mode=mmap)</code> is called to open memmaped file. Following code sample shares memory across multiple container.</p>

<pre><code>from threading import Semaphore

import numpy as np

data = np.load('data/native_format.bin.vectors.npy', mmap_mode='r')
print(data.shape)
# load whole file to memory
print(data.mean())

Everything went quite fantastically as far as I can tell; now I am clustering the word vectors created, hoping to get some semantic groupings.</p>
<p>As a next step, I would like to look at the words (rather than the vectors) contained in each cluster. I.e. if I have the vector of embeddings <code>[x, y, z]</code>, I would like to find out which actual word this vector represents. I can get the words/Vocab items by calling <code>model.vocab</code> and the word vectors through <code>model.syn0</code>. But I could not find a location where these are explicitly matched.</p>
<p>This was more complicated than I expected and I feel I might be missing the obvious way of doing it. Any help is appreciated!</p>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>Match words to embedding vectors created by <code>Word2Vec ()</code> -- how do I do it?</p>
<h3>My approach:</h3>
<p>After creating the model (code below*), I would now like to match the indexes assigned to each word (during the <code>build_vocab()</code> phase) to the vector matrix outputted as <code>model.syn0</code>.
Thus</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (0, newmod.syn0.shape[0]): #iterate over all words in model
    print i
    word= [k for k in newmod.vocab if newmod.vocab[k].__dict__['index']==i] #get the word out of the internal dicationary by its index
    wordvector= newmod.syn0[i] #get the vector with the corresponding index
    print wordvector == newmod[word] #testing: compare result of looking up the word in the model -- this prints True
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Is there a better way of doing this, e.g. by feeding the vector into the model to match the word?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Does this even get me correct results?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*My code to create the word vectors:</p>
<pre><code>model = Word2Vec(size=1000, min_count=5, workers=4, sg=1)
        
model.build_vocab(sentencefeeder(folderlist)) #sentencefeeder puts out sentences as lists of strings

However, I have a distinct feeling that the results could be better, and I'm trying to figure out whether I can adjust the corpus itself in order to improve the results. </p>

<p>I have a certain amount of control over how to split the documents. My original data has a lot of very short documents (mean length is 12 words in a document, but there exist documents that are 1-2 words long...), and there are a few logical ways to concatenate several documents into one. The problem is that I don't know whether it's worth doing this or not (and if so, to what extent). I can't find any material addressing this question, but only regarding the size of the corpus, and the size of the vocabulary. I assume this is because, at the end of the day, the size of a document is bounded by the size of the vocabulary. But I'm sure there are still some general guidelines that could help with this decision.</p>

<p>What is considered a document that is too short? What is too long? (I assume the latter is a function of <code>|V|</code>, but the former could easily be a constant value.)</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with this? Can anyone point me in the direction of any papers/blog posts/research that address this question? Much appreciated!</p>

<p><em>Edited to add:</em>
Regarding the strategy for grouping documents - each document is a text message sent between two parties. The potential grouping is based on this, where I can also take into consideration the time at which the messages were sent. Meaning, I could group all the messages sent between A and B within a certain hour, or on a certain day, or simply group all the messages between the two. I can also decide on a minimum or maximum number of messages grouped together, but that is exactly what my question is about - how do I know what the ideal length is?</p>

<p>Where <code>train_doc_n</code> is a short document, belonging to some label. There are 2400 labels, with 100 training documents per label. <code>eval_doc_0</code> are evaluation documents where I would like to predict their label in the end (using a classifier).</p>

<p>I train a Doc2Vec model with these training documents &amp; labels. Once the model is trained, I reproject each of the original training document as well as my evaluation documents (the ones I would like to classify in the end) into the model's space using <code>infer_vector</code>. </p>

<p>The resulting is a matrix :</p>

y_train (240000,)    # corresponding labels
y_eval  (30, 300)    # doc2vec vectors for evaluation documents

<p>My problem is the following : If I run a simple cross validation on <code>X_train</code> and <code>y_train</code>, I have a decent accuracy.

For the algorithm I need all of the IDs that are assigned to a single word in an unseen document. I will then calculate the most frequent topic id for the given word and assign it as the mode of that word.</p>

<p>I am using the gensim lib so it is very easy to get topic->word dist, where the words are given with their probabilities. However how do I get ""what topic(s) are/were assigned to a single world"", meaning word->topic dists.</p>

<pre><code>Example:
s = ""Banks are closed on Sunday""

Topic -&gt; Word Dist from Gensim:
TopicTag -&gt; Prob*Word
Topic 0 -&gt; 0,3*Bank, 0,2*are
Topic 1 -&gt; 0,2*closed, 0,1*Sunday
Topic 2 -&gt; 0,4*Sunday, 0,3*on

What I want:
word -&gt; TopicTag(Frequency that given word was assigned with the specified topic tag)
Banks -&gt; Topic1(2), Topic2(2)
Closed -&gt; Topic0(1),Topic1 (4)

<p>Please also note that I am not interested in parsing the Topic -> Word Dist results from Gensim, I am interested in finding an accurate way that my model assigns (numerous) topic(s) to each individual word that will come in an unseen document.</p>

<p>At present, I am implementing the Word2Vec algorithm.</p>

<p>Firstly, I have extracted the data (sentences), break and split the sentences into tokens (words), remove the punctuation marks and store the tokens in a single list. The list basically contain the words. Then I have calculated the frequency of words and then computed it occurrences in terms of frequency. It results a list. </p>

<p>Next, I am trying to load the model using gensim. However, I am facing a problem. The problem is about <code>the word is not in the vocabulary</code>. The code snippet, whatever I have tried is as follows.</p>

<pre><code>import nltk, re, gensim
import string
from collections import Counter
from string import punctuation
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg, stopwords

def preprocessing():
    raw_data = (gutenberg.raw('shakespeare-hamlet.txt'))
    tokens = word_tokenize(raw_data)
    tokens = [w.lower() for w in tokens]
    table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
    stripped = [w.translate(table) for w in tokens]
    global words
    words = [word for word in stripped if word.isalpha()]
    sw = (stopwords.words('english'))
    sw1= (['.', ',', '""', '?', '!', ':', ';', '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'])
    sw2= (['for', 'on', 'ed', 'es', 'ing', 'of', 'd', 'is', 'has', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'was', 'are', 'were', 'a', 'an', 'the', 't', 's', 'than', 'that', 'it', '&amp;', 'and', 'where', 'there', 'he', 'she', 'i', 'and', 'with', 'it', 'to', 'shall', 'why', 'ham'])

    words = [w for w in words if not w in stop]

    fd = nltk.FreqDist(words)
    print(fd.most_common())
    freq_count()

            print(word , score)

<p>Note: I am using Python 3.7 in Windows OS. From the <code>syntax of gensim</code>, it is suggested to use sentences and split into tokens and apply the same to build and train the model. My question is that how to apply the same to a corpus with single list containing only words. I have specified the words also using list, i.e. [words], during the training of the model.       </p>

When I try to build the vocabulary I find that word2vec takes the list of lists with the nodes and treats them as single digits, eg that ""143"" becomes ""1"",""4"",""3"".</p>

<p>I already tried to have all the numbers as single entries and see wether it is an formatting problem and went with a buil_vocab_from_freq instead of build_vocab, but this also just produces errors (object of type 'int' has no len()).</p>

<p>My code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models import Word2Vec

def generateEmbeddings(all_walks,dimension,min_count):
    model = Word2Vec(min_count = min_count, size = dimension)
    mylist = list(range(1,1043))
    corpus = {}
    j=1
    for i in mylist:
      corpus[str(i)] = j
      j=j+1
    #mylist = [str(i) for i in mylist]
    print(corpus)
    model.build_vocab_from_freq(corpus)
    model.train(mylist, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs = 30)
    #if it reaches this point it throws the error ""14 not found in vocabulary""
    print(model.wv.most_similar(positive=['14']))
    return model

print(generateEmbeddings(all_walks,128,2))
</code></pre>

<p>I want to get the embedding for eg. the number ""14"" and not ""1"" as it is by now. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>//Edit</p>

<p>I managed to fix this, if anybody else is having this specific problem:
you have to format the list as mentioned as [[""1"",""102"",""43""],[""54"",""43""]] etc.
You cant change the old list at runtime (or at least it didnt work the way I did it), so you could create a new list at runtime with</p>

<pre><code>new_list = []
    for i in all_walks:
      temp_list = []
      for j in i:
        temp_list.append(str(j))
      new_list.append(temp_list)

<p>Currently I am trying to use dask in concert with gensim to do NLP document computation and I'm running into an issue when converting my corpus into a &quot;<a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html#gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TaggedDocument</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>Each attempt at dealing with this problem is met with slightly different woes.</p>

<h1>Error Number 1 No Generators Allowed</h1>
<pre><code>def read_corpus_tag_sub(df,corp='claim_txt',tags=['claim_no']):
    for i, line in enumerate(df[corp]):
        yield gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line), (list(df.loc[i,tags].values)))

tagged_document = df.map_partitions(read_corpus_tag_sub,meta=TaggedDocument)
tagged_document = tagged_document.compute()
</code></pre>
<p>TypeError: Could not serialize object of type generator.</p>
<p>I found no way of getting around this while still using a generator. A fix for this would be great! As this works perfectly fine for regular pandas.</p>
<h1>Error Number 2 Only the first element of each partition</h1>
<pre><code>def read_corpus_tag_sub(df,corp='claim_txt',tags=['claim_no']):
    for i, line in enumerate(df[corp]):
        return gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line), (list(df.loc[i,tags].values)))

tagged_document = df.map_partitions(read_corpus_tag_sub,meta=TaggedDocument)
tagged_document = tagged_document.compute()
</code></pre>
<p>This one is a bit dumb as the function won't iterate (I know) but gives the desired format, but only returns the first row in each partition.</p>
<h1>Error Number 3 function call hangs with 100% cpu</h1>
<pre><code>def read_corpus_tag_sub(df,corp='claim_txt',tags=['claim_no']):
    tagged_list = []
    for i, line in enumerate(df[corp]):
        tagged = gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(line), (list(df.loc[i,tags].values)))
        tagged_list.append(tagged)
    return tagged_list
</code></pre>
<p>Near as I can tell when refactoring the return outside the loop this function hangs builds memory in the dask client and my CPU utilization goes to 100% but no tasks are being computed. Keep in mind I'm calling the function the same way.</p>
<h1>Pandas Solution</h1>
<pre><code>def tag_corp(corp,tag):
    return gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(corp), ([tag]))

tagged_document = [tag_corp(x,y) for x,y in list(zip(df_smple['claim_txt'],df_smple['claim_no']))]
</code></pre>
<p>List comp I haven't time tested this solution</p>
<h1>Other Pandas Solution</h1>
<pre><code>tagged_document = list(read_corpus_tag_sub(df))
</code></pre>
<p>This solution will chug along pretty much for hours. However I don't have enough memory to juggle this thing when it's done.</p>
<h1>Conclusion(?)</h1>
<p>I feel Super lost right now. Here is a list of threads I've looked at. I admit to being really new to dask I've just spent so much time and I feel like I'm on a fools errand.</p>

For example, I use the coherence model to find a model with the best cohrence value subject to the number of topics in range 1 to 5. After getting the best model I use get_document_topics method (thanks <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/6256482/kenhbs"">kenhbs</a>) to get topic distribution in the document that used for creating the model.</p>

<pre><code>id2word = corpora.Dictionary(doc_terms)

bow = id2word.doc2bow(doc_terms)

max_coherence = -1
best_lda_model = None

for num_topics in range(1, 6):

    lda_model = gensim.models.ldamodel.LdaModel(corpus=bow, num_topics=num_topics)

    coherence_model = gensim.models.CoherenceModel(model=lda_model, texts=doc_terms,dictionary=id2word)

    coherence_value = coherence_model.get_coherence()

    if coherence_value &gt; max_coherence:
        max_coherence = coherence_value
        best_lda_model = lda_model
</code></pre>

<p>The best has 4 topics</p>

<pre><code>print(best_lda_model.num_topics)

4
</code></pre>

<p>But when I use get_document_topics, I get less than 4 values for document distribution.</p>

<pre><code>topic_ditrs = best_lda_model.get_document_topics(bow)

print(len(topic_ditrs))

3
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: For best lda model with 4 topics (using coherence model) for a document, why get_document_topics returns fewer topics for the same document? why some topics have very small distribution (less than 1-e8)?</p>

<p>Topic Coherence is a useful metric for measuring the human interpretability of a given LDA topic model. Gensim's <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/coherencemodel.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">CoherenceModel</a> allows Topic Coherence to be calculated for a given LDA model (several variants are included). </p>

<p>I am interested in leveraging <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.LatentDirichletAllocation.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">scikit-learn's LDA</a> rather than <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">gensim's LDA</a> for ease of use and documentation (<em>note: I would like to avoid using the gensim to scikit-learn wrapper i.e. actually leverage sklearn’s LDA</em>). From my research, there is seemingly no scikit-learn equivalent to Gensim’s CoherenceModel. </p>

<p>Is there a way to either:</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> - Feed scikit-learn’s LDA model into gensim’s CoherenceModel pipeline, either through manually converting the scikit-learn model into gensim format or through a scikit-learn to gensim wrapper (I have seen the wrapper the other way around) to generate Topic Coherence?</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p><strong>2</strong> - Manually calculate topic coherence from scikit-learn’s LDA model and CountVectorizer/Tfidf matrices?</p>

<p>I have done quite a bit of research on implementations for this use case online but haven’t seen any solutions. The only leads I have are the documented equations from scientific literature.</p>

<p>If anyone has any knowledge on any similar implementations, or if you could point me in the right direction for creating a manual method for this, that would be great. Thank you!</p>

<p>*Side note: I understand that perplexity and log-likelihood are available in scikit-learn for performance measurements, but these are not as predictive from what I have read.</p>

I am working in a non-linguistic setting where both the number of documents and the number of unique words are small (~100 documents, ~100 words) for practical reasons. Each document has perhaps 10k tokens. My goal is to show that the doc2vec embeddings are more predictive of document class than simpler statistics and to explain which <em>words</em> (or perhaps word sequences, etc.) in each document are indicative of class.</p>
<p>I have good performance of a (cross-validated) classifier trained on the embeddings compared to one compared on the other statistic, but I am still unsure of how to connect the results of the classifier to any features of a given document. Is there a standard way to do this? My first inclination was to simply pass the co-learned word embeddings through the document classifier in order to see which words inhabited which classifier-partitioned regions of the embedding space. The document classes output on word embeddings are very consistent across cross validation splits, which is encouraging, although I don't know how to turn these effective labels into a statement to the effect of &quot;Document X got label Y because of such and such properties of words A, B and C in the document&quot;.</p>
<p>Another idea is to look at similarities between word vectors and document vectors. The ordering of similar word vectors is pretty stable across random seeds and hyperparameters, but the output of this sort of labeling does not correspond at all to the output from the previous method.</p>
<p>Thanks for help in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Here are some clarifying points. The tokens in the &quot;documents&quot; are ordered, and they are measured from a discrete-valued process whose states, I suspect, get their &quot;meaning&quot; from context in the sequence, much like words. There are only a handful of classes, usually between 3 and 5. The documents are given unique tags and the classes are not used for learning the embedding. The embeddings have rather dimension, always &lt; 100, which are learned over many epochs, since I am only worried about overfitting when the classifier is learned, not the embeddings. For now, I'm using a multinomial logistic regressor for classification, but I'm not married to it. On that note, I've also tried using the normalized regressor coefficients as vector in the embedding space to which I can compare words, documents, etc.</p>

However, I'm wondering if the topic distribution of a document fed into an LDA model is also probabilistic. </p>

<p>I have an LDA model as presented here:</p>

<pre><code>lda = models.LdaMulticore(corpus=corpus, id2word=dictionary, num_topics=numTopics,passes=10)
</code></pre>

<p>as well as two documents, Doc1 and Doc2. I want to find the cosine similarity of the two documents in lda space, so that:</p>

<pre><code>x = cossim(lda[Doc1], lda[Doc2]).
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I'm noticing is that when I run this through multiple iterations, the cosine similarity is not always identical. (even when I use the same saved LDA model). The similarity is extremely similar, but it's always a bit off each time. In my actual code I have hundreds of documents, so I'm converting the topic distributions to a dense vector and using numpy to do the calculations in a matrix:</p>

<pre><code>documentsList = np.array(documentsList)
calcMatrix=1-cdist(documentsList, documentsList, metric=self.metric)
</code></pre>

<p>Am I running into a rounding error with numpy (or another bug in my code), or is this behavior I should expect when using lda to find the topic distribution of a document?</p>

<p>Edit: I'm going to run a simple cosine similarity on 2 different documents using my lda model, and plot the spread of results. I will report back with what I find.</p>

<p>Ok, here are the results of running cossine similarity against 2 documents, using the same LDA model. </p>

    for i in range(50):
        doc1bow = dictionary.doc2bow(doc1)
        doc2bow = dictionary.doc2bow(doc2)

        vec1 = lda[doc1bow]
        vec2 = lda[doc2bow]

        S = matutils.cossim(vec1, vec2)
        simList.append(S)


    for entry in simList:

<p>The code causing this error is from <a href=""https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">node2vec</a>. I am porting it to Python 3 but got this error.</p>

<p>I know that in Python 3, len(map) causes error, does it mean Gensim 1.0.1 does not support Python 3 although <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gensim"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pip website</a> says it supports? Or are there some hidden settings?</p>

<p>Anyone has any idea what is wrong? Thanks.</p>

I used the <code>infer_vector</code> but then realised that it considers the query as a document, updates the model and returns the results. I tried using the <code>most_similar</code> and <code>most_similar_cosmul</code> methods but I get words along with a similarity score(I guess) in return. What I want to do is when I enter a search string(a query), I should get the documents (ids) that are most relevant along with a similarity score(cosine etc). How do I get this part done?</p>

I need to use <code>gensim</code>'s tfidf implementation because it's better at dealing with large inputs and then want to put that into a random projection on which I will train my SVM. I'd also be happy to just pass the tfidf model generated by <code>gensim</code> to <code>sklearn</code> and use their random projection, if that makes things easier.<br>
But so far I haven't found a way to get either model out of gensim into sklearn.  </p>

I am comparing each text with all other texts, so I first use itertools to create pairwise combinations like <code>[1,2,3] -&gt; [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]</code>. For memory's sake, I don't do the combinations by having all texts repeated in a big dataframe, but instead make a reference dataframe <code>combinations</code> with indices of the texts, which looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    0   1
0   0   1
1   0   2
2   0   3
</code></pre>

<p>And then in the comparison function I use these indices to look up the text in the original dataframe. The solution works fine, but I am wondering whether I would be able to it with big datasets. For instance I have a 300.000 row dataset of texts, which gives me about a 100 year's worth of computation on my laptop:</p>

<pre><code>C2​(300000) = 300000​! / (2!(300000−2))!
           = 300000⋅299999​ / 2 * 1
           = 44999850000 combinations

<p>To do that, i have already trained a doc2vec model using English wikipeida articles on gensim library. Now i want to compare similarities of new text by inferring vectors from the wiki doc2vec model. 
One of the method i have tried is the gensim docvecs's 'similarity_unseen_docs' function. However, the result isn't really intuitive.
May i know are there any other way to get a similarity score with better performance? Or maybe some part of code is wrong?  </p>

<p>Training of the doc2vec model:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>models = Doc2Vec(dm=1, dm_mean=1, vector_size=300, window=5, min_count=20, epochs =10, sample=0.001, negative=5, workers=cores)
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing similarity:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>arg1='China is  the leader in manufacturing electric vehicle'
arg2='The biggest electric car producer is China'

model.docvecs.similarity_unseen_docs(model=wikimodel, doc_words1=tokenize_text(arg1), 
                                         doc_words2=tokenize_text(arg2), alpha=0.025, min_alpha=0.0001, steps=50)
</code></pre>

<p>The output similarity score is only ~0.25 which doesn't seem to be good.</p>

<p>Here's the code for the training: </p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from gensim.corpora.wikicorpus import WikiCorpus

<p>Currently I am using Gensim in combination with pandas and numpy to run document NLP computation.  I'd like to build a LDA seqential model to track how our topics change over time but am running into errors with the corpus format.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out how to set time slices for dynamic topic models.  I am using <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldaseqmodel.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LdaSeqModel</a> which requires an integer time slice. </p>

<p><strong>The Data</strong></p>

<p>It's a csv:</p>

</div>
</div>
</p>

<p>This is then converted into an array of tuples called the bow_corpus:</p>

</div>
</div>
</p>

<p><strong>Desired Output</strong></p>

<p>It should print one topic allocation for each time slice. If I entered 3 topics and two time slices I should get three topics printed twice showing how the topics evolved over time.</p>

<p>I've tried every version of integer inputs for those time_slices and they all produce errors.  The premise was that the time_slice would represent the number of indicies/rows/documents in each time slice.  For example my data has 1.8 million rows if I wanted two time slices I would order my data by time and enter an integer cutoff like time_slice = [489234, 1310766].

<p>I tried going back to the documentation and looking at the format of the common_corpus used as an example and the format of my bow_corpus is the same.  I also tried running the code in the documentation to see how it worked but it also produced the same error.  I'm not sure if the problem is my code anymore but I hope it is.</p>

<p>I've also tried messing with the file format by manually dividing my csv into 9 csvs containing my time_slices and creating an iterated corpus out of those, but that didn't work.  I've considered converting each row of my csv into txt files and then creating a corpus out of that like David Beil does, but that sounds pointlessly tedious as I already have an iterated corpus.</p>

embedding = model.docvecs.vectors_docs

# setup a TensorFlow session
tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
X = tf.Variable([0.0], name='embedding')
place = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=embedding.shape)
set_x = tf.assign(X, place, validate_shape=False)
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
sess.run(set_x, feed_dict={place: embedding})

# create a TensorFlow summary writer
summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('log', sess.graph)
config = projector.ProjectorConfig()
embedding_conf = config.embeddings.add()
embedding_conf.tensor_name = 'embedding:0'
embedding_conf.metadata_path = os.path.join('log', 'metadata.tsv')
projector.visualize_embeddings(summary_writer, config)
</code></pre>

<p>This code ran without error, but when I type <code>tensorboard --logdir=log</code> and go to the localhost location, it looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQWmi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dQWmi.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>My folder structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>project
   - jupyter_notebook_from_which_I_run_my_code.ipynb
   - log
        - events.out.tfevents.1519305293.COMPUTERNAME
        - notes_metadata.tsv
        - notes_tensor.tsv
        - projector_config.pbtxt
</code></pre>

<p>If I click ""Choose File"" in the TensorBoard projector and choose my notes_tensor.tsv file, it says ""Graph visualization failed: The graph is empty. Make sure that the graph is passed to the tf.summary.FileWriter after the graph is defined.</p>

<p>How do I get the tsv files to show up in the projector for tSNE and PCA visualizations like in the tutorial I linked to earlier?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried adding these two lines:</p>

<pre><code>saver = tf.train.Saver([X])
saver.save(sess, os.path.join('log', 'model2.ckpt'), 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This added these files to <code>log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>checkpoint
model2.ckpt-1.data-00000-of-00001
model2.ckpt-1.index
model2.ckpt-1.meta
</code></pre>

<p>It also gave TensorBoard the <code>Projector</code> tab!</p>

<p>However, there is an error fetching metadata.tsv. This is because it doesn't exist. It's also looking in /log/log instead of just /log. When I dismiss that error, click ""Load"", and choose notes_metadata.tsv, nothing happens.</p>

<p>As such, the idea is that similar sentences are grouped together in several clusters. However, it is not clear to me if I have to train every single document separately and then use a clustering algorithm on the sentence vectors. Or, if I could infer a sentence vector from doc2vec without training every new sentence.</p>

<p>Right now this is a snippet of my code:</p>

<pre><code>sentenceLabeled = []
for sentenceID, sentence in enumerate(example_sentences):
    sentenceL = TaggedDocument(words=sentence.split(), tags = ['SENT_%s' %sentenceID])
    sentenceLabeled.append(sentenceL)

model = Doc2Vec(size=300, window=10, min_count=0, workers=11, alpha=0.025, 
min_alpha=0.025)
model.build_vocab(sentenceLabeled)
for epoch in range(20):
    model.train(sentenceLabeled)
    model.alpha -= 0.002  # decrease the learning rate
    model.min_alpha = model.alpha  # fix the learning rate, no decay
textVect = model.docvecs.doctag_syn0

## K-means ##
num_clusters = 3
km = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters)
km.fit(textVect)
clusters = km.labels_.tolist()

## Print Sentence Clusters ##
cluster_info = {'sentence': example_sentences, 'cluster' : clusters}
sentenceDF = pd.DataFrame(cluster_info, index=[clusters], columns = ['sentence','cluster'])

for num in range(num_clusters):
     print()
     print(""Sentence cluster %d: "" %int(num+1), end='')
     print()
     for sentence in sentenceDF.ix[num]['sentence'].values.tolist():
        print(' %s ' %sentence, end='')
        print()
    print()
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, what I am doing right now is training on every labeled sentence in the document. However, if have the idea that this could be done in a simpler way.</p>

<p>Eventually, the sentences that contain similar words should be clustered together and be printed. At this point training every document separately, does not clearly reveal any logic within the clusters.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone can steer me in the right direction.

<p><strong>How to remove a word completely from a Word2Vec model in gensim?</strong> </p>

<hr>

<h1>Updated</h1>

<p>To answer @vumaasha's comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>could you give some details as to why you want to delete a word</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Lets say my universe of words in all words in the corpus to learn the dense relations between all words. </p></li>
<li><p>But when I want to generate the similar words, it should only come from a subset of domain specific word.</p></li>
<li><p>It's possible to generate more than enough from <code>.most_similar()</code> then filter the words but lets say the space of the specific domain is small, I might be looking for a word that's ranked 1000th most similar which is inefficient. </p></li>
<li><p>It would be better if the word is totally removed from the word vectors then the <code>.most_similar()</code> words won't return words outside of the specific domain.</p></li>

Now I am loading the model, and accessing a specific subset of the vectors based on IDNO. First, I load a <code>pandas</code> df from a database and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>IDNO    author   document
123XYZ  john     the cat sat
234FGH  jane     the dog ran

<p>Then I load the model:</p>

<pre><code>model = Doc2Vec.load('documents_doc2vec_vectorsize100_mincount2_epochs50.model')
</code></pre>

<p>Then I access the three vectors that are in my df:</p>

<pre><code>row_id_list = list(df.row_id)
vectors_tuple = itemgetter(*row_id_list)(model.docvecs)
embedding = np.asarray(vectors_tuple)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create all the necessary <code>TensorBoard</code> files:</p>

<pre><code>tf.reset_default_graph()
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

X = tf.Variable([0.0], name='embedding')
place = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=embedding.shape)
set_x = tf.assign(X, place, validate_shape=False)

sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
sess.run(set_x, feed_dict={place: embedding})

summary_writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('log', sess.graph)

config = projector.ProjectorConfig()
embedding_conf = config.embeddings.add()
embedding_conf.tensor_name = 'embedding:0'
embedding_conf.metadata_path = os.path.join('metadata','metadata.tsv')
projector.visualize_embeddings(summary_writer, config)

saver = tf.train.Saver([X])
saver.save(sess, os.path.join('log', 'model1.ckpt'), 1)

<p>When I run <code>tensorboard --logdir=log</code>, <code>TensorBoard</code> loads, but it says points and dimensions are loading. When I enter Chrome Developer Tools, I get this error:</p>

<p>I had <code>TensorBoard</code> working before, but that was when I set <code>embedding</code> to <code>model.docvecs.vectors_docs</code> rather than accessing specific vectors and pushing them into a <code>numpy</code> array.</p>

<p>It works for me but what I don't like about the resulting word2vec model is that named entities are split which makes the model unusable for my specific application. The model I need has to represent named entities as a single vector. </p>

<p>Thats why I planned to parse the wikipedia articles with spacy and merge entities like ""north carolina"" into ""north_carolina"", so that word2vec would represent them as a single vector. So far so good.</p>

<p>The spacy parsing has to be part of the preprocessing, which I originally did as recommended in the linked discussion using:</p>

<pre><code>...
wiki = WikiCorpus(wiki_bz2_file, dictionary={})
for text in wiki.get_texts():
    article = "" "".join(text) + ""\n""
    output.write(article)
...
</code></pre>

<p>This removes punctuation, stop words, numbers and capitalization and saves  each article in a separate line in the resulting output file. The problem is that spacy's NER doesn't really work on this preprocessed text, since I  guess it relies on punctuation and capitalization for NER (?).</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know if I can ""disable"" gensim's preprocessing so that it doesn't remove punctuation etc. but still parses the wikipedia articles to text directly from the compressed wikipedia dump? Or does someone know a better way to accomplish this? Thanks in advance!</strong></p>

<p>These documents are converted into a corpus of <code>TaggedDocuments</code> with the tags being the typical practice of semantically meaningless ints:</p>

<pre><code>def read_corpus(documents):
    for i, plot in enumerate(documents):
        yield gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(gensim.utils.simple_preprocess(plot, max_len=30), [i])

train_corpus = list(read_corpus(df.document))
</code></pre>

<p>This corpus is then used to train my <code>Doc2Vec</code> model:</p>

<pre><code>model = gensim.models.doc2vec.Doc2Vec(vector_size=50, min_count=2, epochs=55)
model.build_vocab(train_corpus)
model.train(train_corpus, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=model.epochs)
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting vectors of the model are accessed like this:</p>

<pre><code>model.docvecs.vectors_docs
</code></pre>

<p>How would I tie the original df to the resulting vectors? Now that all the documents are trained and vectors are identified for each one, I want to query the set of vectors by author. For example, if I want to return a set of vectors only for Jane, how would I do so?</p>

<p>I think the basic idea is to identify the int tags that correspond to Jane and then do something like this to access them:</p>

<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter 
a = model.docvecs.vectors_docs
b = [1, 2]
itemgetter(*b)(a)
</code></pre>

<p>How would I identify the tags though? They are only meaningful to the model and the tagged documents, so they don't join back to my original df.</p>

However, I want to preserve the old word embeddings and just add the new words from the dataset into the existing model. This means simple retraining of the old model with the new text dataset isn't an option as it will readjust the vectors of the previous word embeddings that are also in the new text dataset. Can you give any suggestions regarding this task? I would like something like Gensim's doc2vec infer feature where you feed the model some text input and it gives a vector as an output. Thanks.</p>

<p>The distribution of skills number for a posting looks like that:</p>
<p>mean        15.12 |
std         11.22 |
min          1.00 |
25%          7.00 |
50%         13.00 |
75%         20.00 |</p>
<p>I've trained a word2vec model using only skill ids and it works more or less fine. I can find most similar skills to a given one and the result looks okay.</p>
<p>But when it comes to a doc2vec model I'm not satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>I have about 3200 unique job titles, most of them have only few entries and there are quite a few of them being from the same field ('front end developer', 'senior javascript developer', 'front end engineer'). I delibirately went for a variety of job titles which I use as tags in doc2vec.TaggedDocument(). My goal is to see a number of relevant job titles when I input a vector of skills into docvecs.most_similar().</p>
<p>After training a model (I've tried different number of epochs (100,500,1000) and vector sizes (40 and 100)) sometimes it works correctly, but most of the time it doens't. For example for a skills set like [numpy, postgresql, pandas, xgboost, python, pytorch] I get the most similar job title with a skill set like [family court, acting, advising, social work].</p>
<p>Can it be a problem with the size of my dataset? Or the size of docs (I consider that I have short texts)? I also think that I misunderstand something about doc2vec mechanism and just ignore it. I'd also like to ask if you know any other, maybe more advanced, ideas how I can get relevant job titles from a skill set and compare two skill set vectors if they are close or far.</p>
<p>UPD:</p>
<p>Job titles from my data are 'tags' and skills are 'words'. Each text has a single tag. There are 40 000 documents with 3200 repeating tags. 7881 unique skill ids appear in the documents. The average number of skill words per document is 15.</p>
<p>My data example:</p>
<pre><code>         job_titles                                             skills

<p>The example of my code:</p>
<pre><code>def tagged_document(df):
    #tagging documents
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        yield gensim.models.doc2vec.TaggedDocument(row['skills'].split(), [row['job_title']])


data_for_training = list(tagged_document(job_data[['job_titles', 'skills']])

#the skill set contains close skills which represent a front end developer

<p>I've been experimenting recently and noticed that it performs a little better if I filter out documents with less than 10 skills. Still, there are some irrelevant job titles coming out.</p>

<p>I'm working with an annotated corpus, such that i have disambiguate words in a given sentence thanks to WordNet synsets id, that i will call tags. For example:</p>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;sentence&gt;
  &lt;text&gt;word1 word2 word3&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;annotations&gt;
    &lt;annotation anchor=word1 lemma=lemma1&gt;tag1&lt;/annotation&gt;
    &lt;annotation anchor=word2 lemma=lemma2&gt;tag2&lt;/annotation&gt;
    &lt;annotation anchor=word3 lemma=lemma3&gt;tag3&lt;/annotation&gt;
  &lt;annotations&gt;
&lt;/sentence&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from this, given an embedding dimension that i will call n, i would like to build an embedding like this:</p>
<h3>Embedding</h3>
<pre><code>lemma1_tag1 dim 1 dim 2 dim 3 ... dim n
lemma2_tag2 dim 1 dim 2 dim 3 ... dim n
lemma3_tag3 dim 1 dim 2 dim 3 ... dim n
</code></pre>
<p>I thought to generate a corpus for Word2Vec starting from each text of each sentence, and replace each <code>anchor</code> with the respective <code>lemma1_tag1</code> (some words can contain more underscore, because i replaced space in lemmas with underscores). Since not every single word is annotated, after a simple preprocessing performed to remove stopwords and other punctuation, in the end i have something like the following example:</p>
<h3>Corpus Example</h3>
<pre><code>let just list most_recent_01730444a headline_06344461n
</code></pre>
<p>Since I'm just interested in annotated words, I also generated a predefined vocabulary to use it as Word2Vec vocabulary. This file contains on each row entries like:</p>
<h3>Vocabulary Example</h3>
<pre><code>lemma1_tag1
lemma2_tag2
</code></pre>
<p>So, after having defined a corpus and a vocabulary, I used them in Word2Vec toolkit:</p>
<h3>Terminal emulation</h3>
<pre><code>./word2vec -train data/test.txt -output data/embeddings.vec -size 300 -window 7 -sample 1e-3 -hs 1 -negative 0 -iter 10 -min-count 1 -read-vocab data/dictionary.txt -cbow 1
</code></pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre><code>Starting training using file data/test.txt
Vocab size: 80
Words in train file: 20811
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the number of words in the corpus is 32000000+ and the number of words in the predefined vocabulary file is about 80000. I even tried in Python with Gensim, but (of course) I had the very same output. I think that the problem is that Word2Vec doesn't consider words in the format <code>lemma1_tag1</code> because of the underscore, and i don't know how to solve this problem. Any hint is appreciated, thank you in advance!</p>

<p>What do I do now to predict a new text if it's of any of the 5 dialects I have?<br>
Also, I looked around and found this code: </p>

<pre><code># load the pre-trained word-embedding vectors 
embeddings_index = {}
for i, line in enumerate(open('w2vmodel.vec',encoding='utf-8')):
    values = line.split()
    embeddings_index[values[0]] = numpy.asarray(values[1:], dtype='float32')

# create a tokenizer 
token = text.Tokenizer()
token.fit_on_texts(trainDF['text'])
word_index = token.word_index

# convert text to sequence of tokens and pad them to ensure equal length vectors 
train_seq_x = sequence.pad_sequences(token.texts_to_sequences(train_x), maxlen=70)
valid_seq_x = sequence.pad_sequences(token.texts_to_sequences(valid_x), maxlen=70)

# create token-embedding mapping
embedding_matrix = numpy.zeros((len(word_index) + 1, 300))
for word, i in word_index.items():
    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)
    if embedding_vector is not None:
        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector
</code></pre>

<p>But it gives me this error when I run it and load my trained word2vec model:</p>

<pre><code>ValueError: could not convert string to float: '\x00\x00\x00callbacksq\x04)X\x04\x00\x00\x00loadq\x05cgensim.utils'
</code></pre>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<p>Actually, there's another code that I didn't post here, I wanted to use word2vec with neural networks, I have the code for neural network, but I don't know how to make the features I got from word2vec to be as an input to the neural net and with labels as output. Is it possible to connect word2vec to a deep neural net and how?</p>

I try to load my trained LdaMallet model to classify new unseen texts.</p>

<p>The first part is loading the model.</p>

<pre><code>import os

dirname = os.path.dirname(__file__)
filename = os.path.join(dirname, 'mallet-2.0.8/bin/mallet')

# Download File: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/dist/mallet-2.0.8.zip

ldaModel = gensim.models.wrappers.ldamallet.malletmodel2ldamodel(ldaMallet)
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure about the last line which converts the ldaMallet to LdaModel. It was the only way to get some result.</p>

<p>Then the second part is preparing the new data and classify it.</p>

<pre><code>from gensim.test.utils import common_dictionary
other_texts = [['new', 'document', 'to', 'classify', 'as', 'array']]
other_corpus = [common_dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in other_texts]

# sorts the result by probability and not by topic ID
print(sorted(vector, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True))
</code></pre>

<p>Then the result looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[(16, 0.143), (17, 0.08), (9, 0.0653),...]
</code></pre>

<p>No matter which text I use in the <code>other_texts</code> array, this result isn't changing, but it should. </p>

<p>There exists severals questions about how to train <code>Word2Vec</code> using <code>gensim</code> with streamed data. Anyhow, these questions don't deal with the issue that streaming cannot use multiple workers since there is no array to split between threads.</p>

<p>Hence I wanted to create a generator providing such functionality for gensim. My results look like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from gensim.models import Word2Vec as w2v

#The data is stored in a python-list and unsplitted.
#It's too much data to store it splitted, so I have to do the split while streaming.
data = ['this is document one', 'this is document two', ...]

#Now the generator-class
import threading

class dataGenerator:
    """"""
    Generator for batch-tokenization.
    """"""

    def __init__(self, data: list, batch_size:int = 40):
        """"""Initialize generator and pass data.""""""

        self.data = data
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.lock = threading.Lock()


    def __len__(self):
        """"""Get total number of batches.""""""
        return int(np.ceil(len(self.data) / float(self.batch_size)))


    def __iter__(self) -&gt; list([]):
        """"""
        Iterator-wrapper for generator-functionality (since generators cannot be used directly).
        Allows for data-streaming.
        """"""
        for idx in range(len(self)):
            yield self[idx]


    def __getitem__(self, idx):

        #Make multithreading thread-safe
        with self.lock:

            # Returns current batch by slicing data.
            return [arr.split("" "") for arr in self.data[idx * self.batch_size : (idx + 1) * self.batch_size]]


#And now do the training
model = w2v(
             sentences=dataGenerator(data),
             size=300,
             window=5,
             min_count=1,
             workers=4
            )
</code></pre>

<p>This results in the error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since <code>dataGenerator(data)</code> would work if I'd just yield a single splitted document, I assume that gensims <code>word2vec</code> wraps the generator within an extra list. In this case the <code>__iter__</code> would look like:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>def __iter__(self) -&gt; list:
    """"""
    Iterator-wrapper for generator-functionality (since generators cannot be used directly.
    Allows for data-streaming.
    """"""
    for text in self.data:
        yield text.split("" "")
</code></pre>

<p>Hence, my batch would also be wrapped resulting in something like <code>[[['this', '...'], ['this', '...']], [[...], [...]]]</code> (=> list of list of list) which cannot be processed by gensim.</p>

<p>This is an LDA Document-Topic Probability List from <code>gensim</code> in which each list is a document and each tuple is one of five topic probabilities. (See an earlier question I posted on Stack Overflow <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33002480/convert-get-documents-topics-to-data-frame"">here</a>). The first element in the tuple represents the topic number, the second element is the probability that the topic probability for the document.</p>

<p>Note that while some documents (like the 3rd list) can have up to five tuples (topic probabilities), gensim LDA does not output probabilities for topics with less 0.01 probabilities. Therefore, examples like document 1 and document 2 have less than five tuples.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Use for loops to create a Document-Topic Probability matrix such that:</p>

<pre><code>ProbMatrix = [(0,0.8,0.2,0,0),
        (0.1,0.3,0.6,0,0),
        (0.05,0.05,0.3,0.4,0.2)]
</code></pre>

<p>As noted above, for ""missing"" tuples (topics), zero's need to be plugged in. Once I get this list, I figure I can use pandas dataframe function to produce my final output (df) such that</p>

<pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame(ProbMatrix)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My (Failed) Attempt:</strong></p>

<pre><code>ProbMatrix = []
for i in data:      #each document i
    for j in i:     #each topic j
        if j[0] == 0:
            ProbMatrix[i,0].append(j[1])
        elif j[0]  == 1:
            ProbMatrix[i,1].append(j[1])
        elif j[0]  == 2:
            ProbMatrix[i,2].append(j[1])   
        elif j[0]  == 3:
            ProbMatrix[i,3].append(j[1])   
        elif j[0]  == 4:
            ProbMatrix[i,4].append(j[1])  
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is how I'm referencing ProbMatrix because I'm receiving the following error:</p>

<pre><code>TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p><strong>Bonus (that is, it'd be even better if you can help):</strong></p>

<p>One problem I've found with gensim LDA is that, as mentioned, it does not output probabilities less than 0.01, even if <code>minimum_probability = None</code>. For example, see this earlier <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17310933/document-topical-distribution-in-gensim-lda/32651946#32651946"">post</a>. The example above is illustrative in that the topic probabilities sum to 1 for each document. However, in reality the output looks more like this:</p>

<pre><code>data = [[(1,0.79),(2,0.2)],  # topic 1 probability 0.79 from 0.8
       [(0,0.09),(1,0.3),(2,0.6)], # topic 0 probability 0.09 from 0.1
       [(0,0.05),(1,0.05),(2,0.3),(3,0.4),(4,0.2)]]
</code></pre>

<p>What I'm looking for is instead of putting zero into unknown topic probabilities, instead make the remaining missing topics an even probability such that topic probabilities for each document equal 1. For example, this would result in a ProbMatrix:</p>

<pre><code>ProbMatrix = [(0.0033,0.79,0.2,0.0033,0.0033),
        (0.09,0.3,0.6,0.005,0.005),
        (0.05,0.05,0.3,0.4,0.2)]

<pre><code>from gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec

0.53626436
</code></pre>
<p>So the most_similar function gives 0.53626441955... (rounds to 0.53626442) and the calculation with numpy gives 0.53626436. Similarly, you can see differences between the values for 'paris' and 'italy' (in similarity compared to 'france'). These differences suggest that the calculation is not being done to full precision (but it is in Gensim). How can I fix it and get the output for a single similarity to higher precision, exactly as it comes from most_similar?</p>
<p>TL/DR - I want to use function('france', 'chirac') and get 0.536264<strong>4195556641</strong>, not 0.536264<strong>36</strong>.</p>
<p>Any idea what's going on?</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE: I should clarify, I want to know and replicate how most_similar does the computation, but for only one (a,b) pair. That's my priority, rather than finding out how to improve the precision of my cossim calculation above. I just assumed the two were equivalent.</p>

Here I am passing one sentence at a time to the gensim.models.Word2Vec() method from my corpus to gradually train the model on my whole corpus. But I am confused what should the value of iter parameter be as I'm not sure whether it iterates over the passed sentence n times or the whole corpus.    </p>

<p>I have tried checking the documentation of gensim. it states the definition as follows:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iter (int, optional) – Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I am confused as I am not passing the whole corpus but only a single sentence on each iteration.</p>

<p>My line in the code that trains the model looks like this:<br>
<code>model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(data, min_count=2, window=arg.window_size, size=arg.dim_size, workers=4, sg=0, hs=0, negative=10, ns_exponent=0.75, alpha=0.025, iter=1)</code>
<br>Here ""data"" represents a single sentence passed at a time from a generator. </p>

<p>Suppose I have a corpus of 2 sentences. ""X is a variable. Y is a variable too."". The model receives data = ""X is a variable."" first and data = ""Y is a variable too."" in 2nd iteration. 
Now to clarify, my question is,<b> whether iter = 50 will train my model iterating though ""X is a variable."" 50 times &amp; ""Y is a variable too."" 50 times or will it iterating though ""X is a variable. Y is a variable too."" (my whole corpus) 50 times.

Unfortunately, the list of results that I receive vary in length and yet the number of words in the document is fixed... How to get TF-IDF results for all words in a document, regardless of the number of modeling documents?</p>

<p>I use the Gensim library to calculate the TF-IDF ratio. Here is my approach:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from gensim import corpora
from gensim import models
from gensim.models import TfidfModel

# Suppose I have a list of words with a random distribution:
docs = [
    ['dog', 'cat', 'panda', 'deer', 'dog', 'elephant', 'panda', 'mouse', 'dog', 'panda', 'dog', 'python', 'penguin', 'lion', 'mouse'],
    ['cat', 'panda', 'rhino', 'lynx', 'panda', 'panda', 'panda', 'koala', 'mammoth', 'hamster', 'cat', 'koala', 'bear', 'fright'],
    ['dog', 'cat', 'elephant', 'panda', 'deer', 'deer', 'baloonfish', 'pig', 'owl', 'dove', 'camel', 'camel', 'camel'],
    ['dog', 'panda', 'mammoth', 'snake', 'lizard', 'elephant', 'partridge', 'alpaca', 'dog', 'dog', 'lizard', 'dog'],
    ['dog', 'owl', 'ostrich', 'porcupine', 'mouse', 'baloonfish', 'croc', 'lion', 'chimp',  'camel', 'doe']
]

# Each document has a certain number of tokens and unique types:
print([len(doc) for doc in docs])  # [15, 14, 13, 12, 11]
print([len(set(doc)) for doc in docs])  # [9, 9, 10, 8, 11]

# I create a dictionary that has 30 unique tokens...
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(docs)  # ['cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'elephant', 'lion', ...]
# ...and corpus containing individual instances of 5 documents
corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in docs]  # [[(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), ...], ...]

# now I'm training tfidf model and applying this model to all corpus documents then I check their length:
model = TfidfModel(corpus)
vector = model[corpus]
print([len(v) for v in vector])  # [9, 9, 10, 8, 11]
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, but now I would like to compare these results with the results obtained for a smaller number of documents based on which the model is built. In order to do this I do the following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code># now I'm training my tfidf model based only on first four documents in corpus:
new_model = TfidfModel(corpus[:4])
new_vector = new_model[corpus]
print([len(v) for v in new_vector])  # [8, 8, 9, 7, 6]

# based on first three:
new_model = TfidfModel(corpus[:3])
new_vector = new_model[corpus]
print([len(v) for v in new_vector])  # [7, 7, 8, 3, 6]

# based on first two:
new_model = TfidfModel(corpus[:2])
new_vector = new_model[corpus]
print([len(v) for v in new_vector])  # [7, 7, 3, 3, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>Can somebody explain to me why the number of results is decreasing? For example, the number of unique tokens in the first document is 9; but when the model is trained on fewer documents, the number of tokens suddenly drops to 8, 7, etc... And yet this document contains a fixed number of tokens. Why not all of them are included in the results? How to include them? Maybe I'm doing something wrong ... I'll be grateful for your help.</p>

Within that package there are several ways to compare an input string with different strings in a text file: First, by looking at the occurrence of words. Only the frequency of words is considered, and not the semantics. The language of the text is therefore not important in that case. The result, however, is that &quot;How old are you?&quot; and &quot;What is your age?&quot; no resemblance, because those sentences consist of only different words.

<p>I have a methodological question that is confused by a deep research in a tiny amount of time.</p>

<p>The question arises from the following problem(s): I need to apply semi-supervised or unsupervised clustering on documents. I have ~300 documents classified with multi-labels and approximately 3400 documents not classified. The number of unsupervised documents could become ~10'000 in the next days.</p>

<p>The main idea is that of applying semi-supervised clustering based on the labels at hands. Alternatively, that of going fully unsupervised for soft clustering.</p>

<p>We thought of creating embeddings for the whole documents, but here lies the confusion: which library is the best for such a task? </p>

<p>I guess the utmost importance needs to lie in the context of the whole document. As far as I know, BERT and FastText provide context-dependent word embedding, but not whole document embedding. On the other hand, Gensim's Doc2Vec is context-agnostic, right?</p>

<p>I think I saw a way to train sentence embeddings with BERT, via the HuggingFace API, and was wondering whether it could be useful to consider the whole document as a single sentence.</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestion? I'm probably exposing my utter ignorance and confusion on the matter, but my brain is melted.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>

<p>Viva!</p>

<p>Edit to answer to @gojomo:</p>

<p>My documents are on average ~180 words. The original task was that of multi-label text classification, i.e. each document can have from 1 to N labels, with the number of labels now being N=18.  They are highly imbalanced.
Having only 330 labeled documents so far due to several issues, we asked the documents' provider to give also unlabeled data, that should reach the order of the 10k.
I used FastText classification mode, but the result is obviously atrocious. I also run a K-NN with Doc2Vec document embedding, but the result is obviously still atrocious.
I was going to use biomedical BERT-based models (like BioBERT and SciBERT) to produce a NER tagging (trained on domain-specific datasets) on the documents to later apply a classifier.
Now that we have unlabeled documents at disposal, we wanted to adventure into semi-supervised classification or unsupervised clustering, just to explore possibilities. I have to say that this is just a master thesis.</p>

### Generating a training/background corpus from your own source of documents
from gensim.corpora import TextCorpus, MmCorpus, Dictionary

# gensim docs: ""Provide a filename or a file-like object as input and TextCorpus will be initialized with a
# dictionary in `self.dictionary`and will support the `iter` corpus method. For other kinds of corpora, you only
# need to override `get_texts` and provide your own implementation.""
background_corpus = TextCorpus(input=YOUR_CORPUS)

# Important -- save the dictionary generated by the corpus, or future operations will not be able to map results
# back to original words.
background_corpus.dictionary.save(
    ""my_dict.dict"")

MmCorpus.serialize(""background_corpus.mm"",
    background_corpus)  #  Uses numpy to persist wiki corpus in Matrix Market format. File will be several GBs.

### Generating a large training/background corpus using Wikipedia
from gensim.corpora import WikiCorpus, wikicorpus

articles = ""enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2""  # available from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download

# This will take many hours! Output is Wikipedia in bucket-of-words (BOW) sparse matrix.
wiki_corpus = WikiCorpus(articles)
wiki_corpus.dictionary.save(""wiki_dict.dict"")

MmCorpus.serialize(""wiki_corpus.mm"", wiki_corpus)  #  File will be several GBs.

### Working with persisted corpus and dictionary
bow_corpus = MmCorpus(""wiki_corpus.mm"")  # Revive a corpus

dictionary = Dictionary.load(""wiki_dict.dict"")  # Load a dictionary

### Transformations among vector spaces
from gensim.models import LsiModel, LogEntropyModel

logent_transformation = LogEntropyModel(wiki_corpus,
    id2word=dictionary)  # Log Entropy weights frequencies of all document features in the corpus

tokenize_func = wikicorpus.tokenize  # The tokenizer used to create the Wikipedia corpus
document = ""Some text to be transformed.""
# First, tokenize document using the same tokenization as was used on the background corpus, and then convert it to
# BOW representation using the dictionary created when generating the background corpus.
bow_document = dictionary.doc2bow(tokenize_func(
    document))
# converts a single document to log entropy representation. document must be in the same vector space as corpus.
logent_document = logent_transformation[[
    bow_document]]

# Transform arbitrary documents by getting them into the same BOW vector space created by your training corpus
documents = [""Some iterable"", ""containing multiple"", ""documents"", ""...""]

logent_documents = logent_transformation[
                   bow_documents]  # ...transformation is done during iteration of documents using generators, so this uses constant memory

### Chained transformations
# This builds a new corpus from iterating over documents of bow_corpus as transformed to log entropy representation.
# Will also take many hours if bow_corpus is the Wikipedia corpus created above.
logent_corpus = MmCorpus(corpus=logent_transformation[bow_corpus])

# Creates LSI transformation model from log entropy corpus representation. Takes several hours with Wikipedia corpus.
lsi_transformation = LsiModel(corpus=logent_corpus, id2word=dictionary,
    num_features=400)

# Alternative way of performing same operation as above, but with implicit chaining
# lsi_transformation = LsiModel(corpus=logent_transformation[bow_corpus], id2word=dictionary,
#    num_features=400)

# Can persist transformation models, too.

### Similarities (the best part)

# A corpus can be anything, as long as iterating over it produces a representation of the corpus documents as vectors.

index = Similarity(corpus=lsi_transformation[logent_transformation[corpus]], num_features=400, output_prefix=""shard"")

print ""Index corpus:""
pprint.pprint(documents)

print ""Similarities of index corpus documents to one another:""

<p>Now my confusion is that Fastext creates vectors for character ngrams of a word too. So for a word ""internal"" it will create vectors for all its character ngrams including the full word and then the final word vector for the word is the sum of its character ngrams. </p>

<p>However, how it is still able to give me vector of a word or even the whole sentence? Isn't fastext vector is for a word and its ngram? So what are these vector I am seeing for the phrase when its clearly two words?</p>

<p>What I have tried:
I have tried using the latest version of numpy, and also forcing it to the version 1.16.4 &quot;pip install --user numpy==1.16.4&quot;. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling both gensim and numpy, but its not working. I am using Python 3.6 and on a cluster. I don't really understand why numpy has no problem being imported, but that this is a problem of gensim.</p>
<p>Can anyone kindly help me out with this?</p>

<p>The problem is that the method to generate the topics (print_topics) receives an argument to indicate the number of topics.
