Raising an issue just to enumerate them all. A full gist of the test traceback is here: https://gist.github.com/nelson-liu/78d08ad0090ad8f95c34675942f5bb4d

- The biggest issue is that we lose the directory structure in the repo. For example, `allennlp` with pip would get installed in `/home/nfliu/miniconda3/envs/test/lib/python3.6/site-packages/allennlp`. this contains _only_ the module (so it's [this folder](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/tree/master/allennlp)).  The `tutorials`, `scripts`, `READMEs`, etc. aren't actually installed anywhere, so all of the paths in the tests break (e.g., script tests that shell out to run `perl ./scripts/some_eval_script.pl`).

- On a separate related note it looks like the precompiled custom extensions in the module aren't copied over either, maybe because they're not `.py` files and they get ignored automatically? This makes the `test_custom_extensions` / `alternating_lstm` tests break, even though they should work. This also means that custom extensions in general aren't working in the `pip install`ed version of allennlp.

## Things that are actually broken in the pip-installed version

- the custom highway lstm (since the extensions aren't included). fixed by #1229 
- `evalb_bracketing_scorer`, since `scripts/EVALB` does not exist. fixed by #1233 
- any tests that rely on files in `./tutorials` and `./scripts`. wip solution in #1232 

The other test errors are just errors with the tests themselves, not with the allennlp package. Which is unfortunate, but it doesn't affect _core_ library functionality.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He succeeded in doing this from the main Dockerfile, but it still doesn't work when installing AllenNLP via pip.

EVALB is included at `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/allennlp/tools/EVALB/` and it seems to be compiled, but the process errors out.

I was wondering why do you quite often limit the upper version of your dependencies. See below a list of all examples from the current `setup.py`

- `""torch>=1.5.0,<1.6.0""`
- `""spacy>=2.1.0,<2.3""`
- `""transformers>=2.9,<2.12""`
- `""filelock>=3.0,<3.1""`

Are you just afraid that the future versions of these packages are going to break `allennlp`? Or you already somehow know they will be incompatible?

In my case, I am encountering a lot of issues because of this strategy. I want to use an older version `allennlp==0.9.0` however there you assert `'spacy>=2.1.0,<2.2'`. My other dependencies, however, require more recent `spacy>2.2`.

Is this intentional? I am asking because I thought the common thing to do is to build vocabulary from train set only so that words in dev/test set that does not occur in train set are converted into `<unk>` and given a single embedding. Building vocabulary from all three sets means that there will be no unknown words in dev/test set (assuming `min_count=1`).",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The vocabulary already does this, but in a particular, hard-coded way.  ELMo embeddings would probably be easier if there were a standard way to do this.  And if we ever want to do byte pair encoding, e.g., you'd want to do it as a `Tokenizer` that takes a pre-computed byte-pair vocabulary (and this is separate from the way that our `Vocabulary` works).

So, we'd want something on `Trainer` that saves all dependent files to the model archive.  That would then call a method on `Vocabulary`, the `DatasetReader`, the `Model`, and anything else, which in turn call the method on `Tokenizers`, `Modules`, and whatever else.  And when loading a model from an archive, these classes all need to know how to modify the paths that they require as input, so they point to the archive somehow instead of pointing to the originally-specified location.  Maybe `update_params_from_archive(params: Params, archive_path: str)`, or something?  That method would update the params for anything that matters - e.g., `Embedding` would remove the path to the pre-trained file, because it's not necessary anymore*, `Vocabulary` would add a path to the saved files, etc.

This is a lot of boilerplate, adding methods on `Model` to pass on calls to `Modules`, etc., but I'm not sure of another way to do this.

\* Actually, maybe `Embedding` would get an option to copy the embedding file over, so that you can still use it at test time, and add words to the embedding as needed...",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unfortunately, I discovered that it's not yet implemented for SRL.

In the meantime, do you have any suggestions for speeding up SRL parsing ?

I've also tried running the `predict` command with `--cuda_device 0` on a Tesla K80, but checking `nvidia-smi ` it seems that there's some bottleneck preventing it from going above 25% GPU usage. Could the lack of batch processing create some overhead that's responsible for that, or am I missing something else?

The keys of the ""token_indexers"" dict passed to TextField aren't used to create the vocabulary namespace (I'm not entirely sure that this is the intended behavior but the tutorial on http://allennlp.org/tutorials/data-pipeline suggests so). Instead the TokenIndexers internal namespace is used, which leads to the behavior as shown in the example code. The specified namespace is ""some_namespace"" but the index is stored under the namespace ""tokens"", which is the default namespace for SingleIdTokenIndexer.

Example code:
```
from allennlp.data import Token
from allennlp.data.fields import TextField
from allennlp.data.token_indexers import SingleIdTokenIndexer
from allennlp.data import Instance
from allennlp.data import Dataset

from allennlp.data import Vocabulary

text_field = TextField(list(map(Token, [""Here"", ""are"", ""some"", ""longer"", ""words"", "".""])),
                       token_indexers={""some_namespace"": SingleIdTokenIndexer()})
dataset = Dataset([Instance({""sentence"": text_field})])

vocab = Vocabulary.from_dataset(dataset)
dataset.index_instances(vocab)

print('Namespaces:', vocab._index_to_token)
print('Namespace content:', vocab.get_index_to_token_vocabulary(""some_namespace""))
```

4. In general 'pip install -r requirements.txt' worked weirdly and I ended up running each line individually, I didn't dig into why that was.

Upon switching to the `LettersDigitsWordSplitter` that solves this problem, the squad debug output for the actual tokens generated is just a list of token objects and their addresses (as opposed to readable strings), since `__repr__` / `__str__` isn't implemented.

https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

I have trained a model, and now I need to create a CSV of predictions on the test set. The input file is a CSV {""comment_id"", ""comment_text""}. Right now in order to run `predict` on this, I have to convert it to a JSONL file. That's not hard, but it seems like an unnecessary step.

The relevant code in `predict.py` is

```
    batch_json_data = []
    for line in input_file:
        if not line.isspace():
            # Collect batch size amount of data.
            json_data = json.loads(line)
            batch_json_data.append(json_data)
            if len(batch_json_data) == batch_size:
                _run_predictor(batch_json_data)
                batch_json_data = []
```

Of course we don't want to break backward compatibility. One immediate idea is to give the base `Predictor` class a method

```
def line_to_json(line: str) -> JsonDict:
    return json.loads(line)
```

and then call that (rather than `json.loads`) from `predict.py`. Then in my example I could override it like

```
def line_to_json(line: str) -> JsonDict:
    id, text = parse_csv_line(line)
    return {""id"": id, ""text"": text}
```

and be able to use my `test.csv` rather than have to make a JSONL file.

and then probably we'd do the same for the output:

```
def json_output_to_line(line: str) -> JsonDict:
    return json.dumps(line)
```

and I'd override that too

Before I through everything onto the computing cluster, I ran a test with only 5 training pairs which are about **2.4 kb in total**. I add `memory_profiler` decorator to track the memory usage.

This is what I have in the end:
```
Filename: run.py

Line #    Mem usage    Increment   Line Contents
\================================================
    18     49.3 MiB     49.3 MiB   @profile
    19                             def profWrap() -> None:
    20    148.7 MiB     99.4 MiB       cProfile.run('from allennlp.commands.train import train_model_from_file')
    21    377.7 MiB    228.9 MiB       cProfile.run('train_model_from_file(""./model/baseline.json"", ""./result"")')
```
I was shocked, the memory usage increase 150 thousands times.....",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
