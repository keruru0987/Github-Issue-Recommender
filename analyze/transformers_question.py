i.e we have a domain-specific data (example: sentences talking about automobiles)</p>

<p>Our data is just a bunch of sentences and what we want is to give a phrase and get back the sentences which are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Similar to that phrase</li>
<li>Has a part of a sentence that is similar to the phrase</li>
<li>A sentence which is having contextually similar meanings </li>
</ol>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Let me try giving you an example suppose I search for the phrase "Buying Experience", I should get the sentences like:</p>

<ul>
<li>I never thought car buying could take less than 30 minutes to sign
and buy.</li>
<li><p>I found a car that i liked and the purchase process was<br>
straightforward and easy</p></li>
<li><p>I absolutely hated going car shopping, but today iâ€™m glad i did</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br/>
I want to lay emphasis on the fact that we are looking for <strong>contextual similarity</strong> and not just a brute force word search.</p>

<p>If the sentence uses different words then also it should be able to find it.</p>

<p>Things that we have already tried:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/" rel="noreferrer">Open Semantic Search</a> the problem we faced here is generating ontology from the data we have, or
for that sake searching for available ontology from different domains of our interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Elastic Search(BM25 + Vectors(tf-idf)), we tried this where it gave a few sentences but precision was not that great. The accuracy was bad
as well. We tried against a human-curated dataset, it was able to get around 10% of the sentences only.</p></li>
<li><p>We tried different embeddings like the once mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers" rel="noreferrer">sentence-transformers</a> and also went through the <a href="https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/blob/master/examples/application_semantic_search.p" rel="noreferrer">example</a> and tried evaluating against our human-curated set
and that also had very low accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>We tried <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/elmo-contextual-language-embedding-335de2268604" rel="noreferrer">ELMO</a>. This was better but still lower accuracy than we expected and there is a
cognitive load to decide the cosine value below which we shouldn't consider the sentences. This even applies to point 3.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Any help will be appreciated. Thanks a lot for the help in advance</p>

As my use case needs functionality for both English and Arabic, I am using the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/multilingual.md" rel="noreferrer">bert-base-multilingual-cased</a> pretrained model. I need to be able to compare the similarity of sentences using something such as cosine similarity. To use  this, I first need to get an embedding vector for each sentence, and can then compute the cosine similarity.</p>

<p>Firstly, what is the best way to extratc the semantic embedding from the BERT model? Would taking the last hidden state of the model after being fed the sentence suffice?</p>

<pre><code>import torch
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer

model_class = BertModel
tokenizer_class = BertTokenizer
pretrained_weights = 'bert-base-multilingual-cased'

tokenizer = tokenizer_class.from_pretrained(pretrained_weights)
model = model_class.from_pretrained(pretrained_weights)

sentence = 'this is a test sentence'

input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(sentence, add_special_tokens=True)])
with torch.no_grad():
    output_tuple = model(input_ids)
    last_hidden_states = output_tuple[0]

print(last_hidden_states.size(), last_hidden_states)
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, if this is a sufficient way to get embeddings from my sentence, I now have another problem where the embedding vectors have different lengths depending on the length of the original sentence. The shapes output are <code>[1, n, vocab_size]</code>, where <code>n</code> can have any value. </p>

<p>In order to compute two vectors' cosine similarity, they need to be the same  length. How can I do this here? Could something as naive as first summing across <code>axis=1</code> still work? What other options do I have? </p>
